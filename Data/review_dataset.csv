13,fluoxetine,most of my life i have struggled with severe panic attack general anxiety ptsd amp moderate depression been on med twice before until i felt better amp then i would stop taking them this last time it had been close to a year that i had been suffering again before i decided to reluctantly go back on med i tried celexa again it worked kinda okay in the past but this time it made no improvement for me saw the doc who switched me to prozac all i can say is wow best yet i feel like my old happy self after only month mg the first week the second and mg the last two give it time to work amp be patient it might make you feel a bit off amp not better at first but it is a miracle drug these bad feeling will pas hang in there
14,fluoxetine,ive been on every antidepressant known to mankind and they were awful to me either the side effect were too bad or it turned me into a complete zombie to the point work wa out of the question and then my dr said we would try one more called prozac and the reason he had not prescribed it before wa because it took week to reach full effect a where the others took le then half that time i started out taking mg because i have always been very sensitive to antidepressant and their side effect for about the first or week i experience light anxiety then finally the week passed and still nothing but then finally about week into the mediation i feel like santa clause on steroid it ha saved my life
15,fluoxetine,i am a year old male in i wa going through a very serious bout with anxiety and depression luckily there wa a place called freedom from fear on staten island that wa able to counsel me free of charge a wa affiliated with columbia university and a doctor there prescribed for me a new drug that wa just approved and availableprozac i took it for eight month or so and recovered so much so that it helped me deal with the tragedy of my mother dying only a year later yes this medicine saved my life this is are the reason i am here right now i only took the medicine for that eight month and slowly got off it here i am year later totally fine
16,adderall,help me keep my attention in class but seems to make me keep grinding my teeth and move my jaw around a tick i guess
17,alprazolam,this is an exceptional medicine i have been on it for only a couple of week i have tried seroquel trazodone ambien and none of these have worked but alprazolam is a miracle medicine
18,fluoxetine,this is one of the only drug that i dont have any side effect from
19,alprazolam,xanax got me through a year or so of acute anxiety and debilitating panic attack i got rather attached to those pretty lavender pill i called them quotmy darling little easter eggsquot they were so precious in relieving the terror that developed into agoraphobia at max dose i wa so sedated i started calling it quotzombinalquot it had stopped working it magic and under the care of a naturopath i simply stopped taking it amazingly after a couple of shaky day my anxiety diminished and panic attack were history i later learned that between depleted receptor and miniwithdrawls xanax wa actually causing my symptom no more xanax no more panic not even the slightest anxiety i guess i got cured
20,prozac,prozac really worked for me it kept my depression under control along with my anxiety only side affect is you can forget about sex i also experienced short term memory loss
21,prozac,i am beginning my fourth week on mg fluoxetine taken each morning i am recovering from a long term abusive relationship with a narcissist i have a head injury that predisposes me to fatigue i asked the doctor to help me with my energy level i did not admit it but the underlying feeling i had wa that everything wa too much and nothing matter anyway but nobody would have guessed how hopeless i had become and had been for at least year initially i experienced all of the symptom people warn about in the first few week insomnia and occassional extreme anxiety were the worst now i feel enthused about taking thing one at a time and am enjoying the process i have begun to sleep normally again so far so good
22,adderall,i just started adderal mg about a week now before i wa on mg not extended release just tab for month im always so tired the higher dose help me stay awake and function through my day glad something work so far no side effect noted
23,alprazolam,i wa extremely against xanax because of knowing people who abused it and being someone who will try homeopathic cure before using prescription that said it really help me i have anxiety i would describe a anywhere from mild severe depending on the day and week but sometimes i get in these intensely anxious thought pattern where i can not let go it medication during these period is a godsend it allows me to return back to my normal nonanxious self i rarely have noticed sleepiness a an effect of the medication only when i wa already sleepy before taking it if you dont abuse your dose it shouldnt cause you to feel out of it or have memory loss if you truly suffer from anxiety thats my experience
24,fluoxetine,i tried several other antidepressant before being prescribed fluoxetine it ha really made a huge difference in my life i used to suffer from constant anxiety racing thought depression and suicidal thought i couldnt drive a car go grocery shopping order fast food leave my house or even talk to friend and family without having a mental breakdown eventually i wa completely dysfunctional and hopeless in combination with dbt therapy i have greatly improved i still have sad day but my anxiety is pretty much nonexistent life is not a constant struggle when i first started fluoxetine i wa very nauseous and could not orgasm after a few day the nausea wore off and with practice my sex life returned to normal
25,fluoxetine,ive tried a few antidepressents zoloft wellbutrin remeron ive been on prozac for nearly three month i wa prescribed mg a day for the first month and told the doctor i didnt notice anything she still kept me on mg a day for the second month still nothing but drowsiness wa a problem gone now ive been on mg a day for the past three week and in the past week or so i think something about me is different i rarely have the suicidal thought i did before i still do though im also normally really awkward but now i feel natural when i say something no shaky voice idk how to explain what im feeling the past week ive been pretty nauseous though i usually eat a lot though so i dont mind it
26,fluoxetine,hi first of all i am a woman who didnt believe in any antidepressant ever then came the dreaded monster i call menopause well for me it wa tough not all woman have it so bad anyways i met with my dr and told her everything that i felt and she prescribe of prozac i came home saying to myself gee i cant take this i heard so much negative thing back in the s in high school then i said well it either giving it a try and hope for the best or lose my husband of yr and cry more so i took a pill that same afternoon and wow i can say it took about week before major difference buti am thankful everyday and night a i am so much happier
27,fluoxetine,very positive experience i have tried wellbutrin celexa pristiq cymbalta effexor and prozac fluoxetine is the only one i can take with no side effect all others i had to stop early on because of unbearable side effect fluoxetine make me feel better but only at a lower dose if i take mg or over i feel lethargic give it a try
28,xanax,ive suffered from generalized anxiety for year at one point i could barely leave my house afraid to drive on bridge tunnel fly i even had anxiety about taking taking anxiety medication xanax wa a game changer for me i rarely take it but ive taken trip i never thought i would be able to take get this i wa even able to skydive not bad for an agoraphobic it build confidence just having it in my pocket really help i had to take a mg dose tonight because ive been in panic mode for five day and i finally needed to reset my mental state i think david burn quotfeeling good handbookquot is an awesome tool too im rambling because after day of super anxiety i finally took a and now i feel great
29,fluoxetine,prozac took my worry away that is all i wanted i wasnt depressed i used to wake up at night having bad dream and worry that went over and over in my head i couldnt sleep after beginning prozac that all stopped it did unfortunately give me an quoti dont carequot attitude about what other people thought of me my sister complained about that with me and said i wa difficult to talk to so i stopped taking it gradually now i wake up every night again with terrible anxiety thought and dream mostly about thing that are happening in my life i havent heard anyone talking about this any comment
30,adderall xr,it help keep me calm and focused at work i do suffer insomnia if i dont take my daily dose consistently i tried to stop taking it and my metabolism took a severe nose dive even though i never had weight problem before i did lose about ten pound when i started taking it but it leveled off and i wa able to maintain a healthy weight i would have liked to try a more natural approach to managing my add but the weight gain ha added depression and therefore im back on it
31,alprazolam,ive been taking low dose mg xanax for a few year for social anxiety and occasional panic attack it excellent i take it a needed which i like it let me feel more in control i rarely take a full dose it very effective even in a lower dose it just let me keep anxiety under control so i can function well i never notice any major fogginess or anything with it either unlike other benzos ive taken like ativan just in moderation a little go a long way absolutely great medication for anxiety and occasional severe panic attack it ha completely helped me build my confidence up and get my life back
32,alprazolam,only med that ha ever really worked for me ive tried every holistic approach to treat my anxiety taking a take the edge off like nothing else im afraid to take med but taking xanax doesnt make me nervous i only take it when my anxiety and panic come back sometimes i have it under control for long period of time i read a lot of negative thing about becoming addicted and the withdrawal effect but most of u who really suffer hate taking med we rather get better with no drug it help me calm down so i can think clearly and get through the day or night wanted to post something positive for those who are afraid to take it
33,prozac,i have always had anxiety however about month ago i began to have panic attack walking to the shop by myself walking to work i thought i wa going to pas out it wa awful then one day i just couldnt walk to work i got half way then i wa convinced i wa going to faint so walked home i then realized how out of control my anxiety had become my partner went with me the doctor prescribed me mg tablet once a day the first week my anxiety wa definitely heightened it felt like i wa losing the plot however within a month i found myself walking to the shop and work feeling fine i havent had a panic attack for over month i wish i had started this medication sooner i now feel normal again
36,prozac,it took a few month for it to start to settle in i think but total game changer month ago i wa in an awful state due to undiagnosed ocd amp depression started going to therapy and taking prozac and now it feel like im standing on more solid ground i havent felt this good in year and feel silly for my past apprehension at trying ssri only side effect ive noticed are im a bit sleepy throughout the day and im having vivid dream most night never remembered my dream before taking prozac but no complaint about the latter recently bumped up to mg after being on for a few month to try and kick the last of the obsessive thought really couldnt recommend enough i can only hope this keep working
38,alprazolam,i wa put in a mental hospital involuntarily and wa given alprazolam mg bar a a anxiety med this med completely knocked me out when i woke up i didnt have any idea what i had done before i took the pill and i didnt remember falling asleep i think this medication can be really dangerous if not taken responsibly and i would not recommend this medication at all
39,prozac,i started taking prozac week ago after mirtazapine stopped working i wa suffering with bad ocd anxiety and panic attack on a daily basis when i first started on the medication i thought it would be a miracle drug however the side effect were horrendous for solid week i wa a mess i wa depressed i dont even suffer with depression i wa cry at my desk all the time i had horrible thought crippling anxiety would not leave my house or talk to anyone the only thing that would get me through the day wa diazapam i am on mg and after week it wa like a light turned on and i have been normal for week straight i am so happy i stuck with it i know it hard but trust me it worth it
40,xanax,i have been on xanax mg tablet twice a day for about year due to a panic ha been fantastic then there wa a time when i stopped them a i only used them when needed it is comforting to know you have them just incase a they are fantastic to calm down anxiety since the onset of menopause my body just broke down into a million piece and my anxiety went through the roof so once again im taking a day until this all settle back down i can recommend these tablet they are amazingyay for xanax
41,fluoxetine,i wa on mg prozac daily for stressanxietydepression after having an eating disorder for year and felt after year i hit a plateau and weaned myself off of it when i missed a dose i definitely felt the anxiety creep back and depression set it but got sick of feeling numb with no emotion and unable to cry even when i wanted to i however after being off of it for a year and trying it again because i know i didnt gain weight on it which wa my biggest fear i am afraid to try another medicine and frankly dont feel like going through the week you have to wait to see if they work i know i liked prozac in all when i wa on it and just hope the plateau i felt is gone
43,alprazolam,very helpful in falling and staying asleep
44,alprazolam,i wa taking mg per day at equal interval i tried to stop completely and the noise came roaring back so i went back on mg per day and the noise is reduced by or more with minimal side effect so far
45,xanax,i have a panic disorder and have been taking xanax for over yr now never had to increase my dose and finally can live a normal life the doctor had tried all different medication and this is the only one that worked
46,adderall,this medicine is amazing i used to always be the last one to turn in test in high school now i take one in the morning and in about an hour feel like i am my true self with it i can process information clearly easily and very efficiently now i have no problem with writing essay answering indepth question secondguessing myself i even found that i am a lot more confident with many thing ranging from presentation to girl i also take much better care of myself throughout the day except when it come to eating for i do experience the loss in appetite to describe it it is almost like an auto tuneup program except for your brain adderall is absolutely great for me
47,adderall,hyper focused dry mouth both this and straterra put me into state of manic used depakote mg for mental balance
49,fluoxetine,i have been taking prozacgoing on week now the symptom are almost unbearable my stomach get upsetcan barely eat i cant even sleep at all it like i am tiredbut i cant sleep and i feel tired all day the one thing i cant standis the light headed feelingand i am shaky all the time it get bad im about ready to throw this medication in the trash the symptom are almost a bad a my anxiety attack in factit make it worse
51,xanax,with the panic attack i get it seems xanax work fairly fast when i feel one coming on or even when i am in the middle of one it calm me down and i can cope i have taken it for several year and have felt no side effect i am glad it is available to me
52,alprazolam,i have panic disorder and xanax ha helped me greatly the only problem that i have experienced is that i have become resistant to it rather than mg helping i need to take to calm down my doctor only allows me mg pill per month so im petrified that at some point i am going to have an attack after i have run out of med
54,prozac,i started to take prozac several month back to get off effexor it really made that transition smooth i take mg every other day i find it help with anxiety but not enough to wean off klonopin i know im normally over social and prozac make me antisocial i dont mind because im only antisocial with people i dont need to be associated with i believe my ability to orgasm ha improved from effexor to prozac i tend to sleep more than i should but it better than tossing and turning my motivation is at an all time low right now i dont know if it the prozac or work i gained weight initially but it coming off slowly and evening out i would recommend prozac it not a feelingresponsibility numbing a others med
55,fluoxetine,didnt help made me feel weird should not be used in teen
57,prozac,prozac worked great for me for about year and then it quit being effective apparently this experience is so common it even called quotprozac poopoutquot at age i started taking mg daily then increased to for the first week or two i felt slightly nauseated and had trouble getting an erection then those sideeffects vanished and i felt not only happier but more functional at the time i wa a university professor i wrote published novel during those two year a wonderful sideeffect is that i gained total ejaculatory control suddenly i wa the lover id always wanted to be but after the prozac honeymoon i found myself feeling anxious and depressed again and the prozac wa just making me sleepy so i quit cest la vie
59,alprazolam,if i could rate xanax higher i would this is without a doubt the most effective medication ive ever taken for anxiety and fast acting ive always dealt with the public speaking anxiety since high school im healthy and active and have never been depressed so thats why ive been reluctant about ssri my gp prescribed celxa went up to mg and it wa a nightmare had panic attack and very vivid intrusive thought my gp switched to lexapro mg and i still get panic attack if i get a panic attack i take a mg of xanax and it take like min to kick in and i feel great i hate ssri and wish xanax wa a daily med
60,fluoxetine,i am so happy that i finally received a diagnosis and treatment ever since i wa about year old now i have dealt with depression that came in wave my anxiety and obsessive tendency didnt begin until i wa and had the military i always thought that the high stress situation just fed into my depression and caused anxiety and obsession i finally decided to seek help and i wa shocked to find out that i suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder which cause depression and anxiety i started on prozac and within the first week i felt a rush of relief i no longer obsessed over the smallest thing i feel so much happier and my friend and family notice the difference big time
61,adderall,i have adhd and have been taking adderall for year now i take mg in the morning and sometimes a mg in the afternoon it help me to focus in school and get better grade i have gotten to the point where i will not even go to school without it
62,xanax,xanax helped me major status when i wa year old tried spice it a messed up chemical synthetic thc bull anyways i smoked three bowl and then boom i couldnt breath my hand and muscle tightened up and i couldnt move and my chest felt like i had pound on it i thought i wa dying and my whole body wa tingly went to the hospital and they diagnose with gad and panic disorder for three month i did not leave my house and i thought i wa dying of the time so my doctor put me on ativan for a month i stopped taking it in day i felt like i wa going insane so i wa given xanax for a month the first time taking it boom it all stopped i wa a normal person it helped me get over all my panic attack mg a needed
63,prozac,i take this medicine primarily for obsessive compulsive disorder but i also have depression and general anxiety disorder that it help with i took it several year ago but it pooped out on me and my psychiatrist decided to try it again about two year ago i worked up to mg because she said that i needed a really high dosage i take it when i wake up in the morning and find it activating it so weird because i find thing that i realize i do now that i wouldve never done before being on this medicine it such a good feeling each time i realize that and am reminded of how far ive come i love this medication and really really hope i can stay on it this time and not have it poop out on me
65,adderall,keep you focused however when it wear off i cant sleep till hour later
66,fluoxetine,prozac ha taken my body ache away prevents me from obsessing over what someone else did or said help with anxiety depression stress and cry a lot of the other medication i had an allergic reaction to or they made me lethargic and gain weight problem with short term memory and retaining new information but that could be my age of
70,prozac,been on fluoxetine for week now i got my script from my gp i told him i wanted to start with mg in the morning and at night that didnt work out because it affected the last hr of sleep so i just started taking the mg in the morning at first i would feel jittery for a few hour into my th week im good unfortunately i made the mistake of reading about the side effect a little too thoroughly by that i mean i read the pharmacology part for health care professional there i stumbled on a possible side effect that really bother me alopecia im a man in my early s ha anyone heard anything about losing hair on prozac
71,adderall xr,im an year old girl and i have add along with bipolarschizoaffective because i have psychotic symptom the highest dose of adderall i can take is mg my problem is it doesnt keep me focused more then hour or so because the dose is low and even though it a low dose i cant seem to eat at all ive been struggling with my weight for a while due to hyperthyroidism im and lb my goal weight is i cant afford to lose more weight the risk are outweighing the very minimal benefit
74,fluoxetine,prozac really saved my life year ago when i wa suffering from major obsessive compulsive disorder and insomnia related to it tried to stop it few time but always had to come back no sexual side effect even at mgday unofortunately it seemed that the medicine had poopedout on me after year and i currently started taking paxil
75,alprazolam,i wa prescribed xanax in when i started college at age have panic disorder anxiety disorder and ptsd dosage ha always been mg daily im completely a different person with it no more stuttering no more panic attack and running out if class to hide ive never had to increase the dose since i could never gave gotten through year of college without it
76,alprazolam,this medicine is great no side effect calm me down help with the racing thought at night and to relax and get to sleep i also had panic attack now with xanax they are gone i only take mg at night and a needed when nervous or with social anxiety if i go out it work wonder it is sad that many doctor do not want to prescribe it because of stigma of abuse and it really would help many people with anxiety disorder
77,fluoxetine,ive been on mg fluoxetine for just over one week i did take it for a few day a little while ago it made my ibs worse so i stopped my doctor persuaded me to give it another go i know it early day but so far it all bad before i wa tired unmotivated no concentration barely able to wash or do the simplest thing now im like the walking dead even more tired even le motivation brain fog you name it and possibly more depressed i also had terrible joint pain i have arthritis anyway the joint pain seem to be lessening the others arent so far i just hope it a case of getting worse before it get better co atm it almost unbearable
78,prozac,ive been taking prozac for about year i took mg then mg a of last year it worked very well for a very long time and i felt great for year but im finally starting to feel a tolerance to it effect and it might be time to switch medication but it certainly been a good run it helped me feel better and lifted my depression
79,alprazolam,in my opinion this medicine ha saved my life it keep me calm and relaxed it ha been my miracle drug i never knew life could be this good again i try not to remember the life i had before taking xanax
80,fluoxetine,i took prozac several year ago and it worked a little bit for a while often though it made me feel really lethargic sleepy and extremely apathetic to most thing it sort of did it job but not well enough a i have now switched to something that work better
81,fluoxetine,this drug saved my life it did not work for the first month and a half but when it did amazing result no anxiety and i suffered from panic attack not saying this drug alone will fix all your problem but it helped me so so much gave me my excitement for life back
82,prozac,prozac ha saved my life i wa unable to function normally and wa very irritable i have been taking it for month and it is amazing other than not feeling hungry and feeling numb to thing that formerly made me irate i have had no bad side effect i am finally living only wish i had the nerve to take it year ago i missed out on so much due to my severe depression
83,adderall,it work but i think it might be the effect from having extra energy so you do more thing it definitely help with motivation and depression ironically it got rid of my anxiety a well
85,fluoxetine,i wa on prozac for mild depression and mild ocd the dosage kept increasing over the year a it wa le effective until i wa on mg for the last five year i had to come off it a it gave me tinnitus and then hyperacusis severe i tried other medication which made this much louder and it ha remained even though it ha been year off all drug coming off the prozac wa so traumatic my anxiety wa so extreme i had a complete nervous breakdown wa paranoid and my ocd became extreme i now have permanent hyperacusis tinnitus anxiety severe ocd i can not leave the house and live in hell i can not hear any music at all a it get stuck in a loop prozac ha absolutely ruined my life
86,fluoxetine,i wa having hot flash every night from being perimenopause and i recently started on mg of prozac it took approximately week for it to start working and i swear by it by the th week not one hot flash i am feeling so much relief from prozac not only have my hot flash gone away but my mood are stable and i feel great
89,fluoxetine,id struggled with bulimia and depression for many year i wa prescribed prozac to mainly treat my depression and partly the eating disorder with my personal experience with bulimia i never had the urge to binge eat just to make myself vomit after eating proper sized portion of food i had found that the prozac had helped stopped the urge to throw up after eating quite effectively the only side effect being that once i had stopped taking it the urge returned immediately currently and trying to battle those thought without being prescribed medication but may go back onto it if im unsuccessful after a year or so
90,alprazolam,i started out on valium mg time a day when i wa due to petitmal seizure the doctor said my anxiety wa causing my blood pressure to go out the roof at age had a heart attack due to anxiety making my bp so high i wa in v fib now at age im taking xanax mg time a day for me all the antidepressant cause some kind of stimulation hat make my anxiety worsen so i stopped the ssri it is working for now but i fear what happens when this doesnt work anymore what am i going to do so tired of having anxiety and panic disorder i dont think too many doctor understand what a profound problem this cause in one life so really express how you really feel to your doc
92,alprazolam,im prescribed mg of xanax a needed if i ever feel very anxious and take xanax my anxiety level tune down to a im almost too relaxed however xanax can be very habit forming so only take your dose
93,alprazolam,work excellent for anxiety have horrible social anxiety which i also take zoloft for but xanax doesnrsquot really help with it not knowing cause my drrsquos didnrsquot tell me but after being on this a while and at a high dose for me up to mgday if you donrsquot take it everyday you feel like rubbish took me almost year to figure this out so regardless if i need it or not i take maybe mg a a maintenance dose in the middle of the day greatly help to not feel sick i also take mg of temazepam at night which i thought would cover me but for the past day my mood ha been really bad the worst in year and a couple mgrsquos of xanax greatly improves it but wouldnrsquot recommend it since itrsquos not prescribed to take it that way
97,xanax,act very quickly and definitely feel the calming effect the only downside is that it doesnt last very long hr max maybe even le and you quickly build up a tolerance for it so you end up having to take much more the more you use it
98,adderall xr,started off with concerta in may it wa not effective at all switched over to adderall xr mg in july for seven day a a starter dose then started adderall xr mg i noticed a considerable difference between the two medicine instantly i am able to focus for a very long period of time without being distracted my grade improved exceptionally i went from receiving grade below now my lowest grade is the benefit of this medicine do outweigh the side effect for me i noticed minute after taking adderall i have increased bowel movement lower libido and decreased appetite i stop taking adderall during break and long weekend the first day not on it i am extremely tired exercising and eating healthy help
99,alprazolam,ive been on benzos for the past year i got started on diazepam mg x daily for about month worked good but stopped working pretty quickly then got bumped up to diazepam mg x daily same result month laterfelt like i wa taking nothing then my doctor mentioned alprazolam he put me on mg x daily along with wellbutrin the xanax worked great but ive always had bad reaction to ssri so my doctor got me off the wellbutrin and put me on alprazolam mg x daily ive been on the same dose for over a year and a halfand ha worked perfectly great medication but it doe have the potential for abuseaddiction be careful with that because withdrawal from any benzo is horrific
100,prozac,i started taking prozac in april of for anxiety and depression it took about a month to actually start working i feel better going into public and dont freak out and go into the bathroom im still depressed but it improved so much it gave me side effect like lose of appetite i lost pound my first month taking it and i wa always tired but had trouble falling asleep another negative is if i miss it a day i have painful headache and lash out on everyone and treat them terrible

142,fluoxetine,i had very bad anxiety and wa prescribed prozac i found the initial side effect very difficult and didnt feel quite right for some time and wa constantly doubting the medicine however after eight week of taking it the side effect have subsided and i feel back to my usual self what a relief if you are finding it tough hang on in there im sure you will get there
143,fluoxetine,the medicine helped with my depression at first but eventually stopped working and needed to be increased i completely lost all of my sex drive and that wa very disappointing a that lead to frustration which lead to depression i stopped taking prozac and still have no sex drive which is apparently very common i would not recommend this medicine
145,fluoxetine,well i just started taking prozac to help me deal with depression and anxiety i returned from from a tour in iraq about three month ago and my symptom kept getting worse and worse ive been taking prozac for about a week now and im already feeling relief from it it like all the problem are still there they just dont get to me like they used to it been very helpful so far
146,adderall,adderall ha helped me greatly though it is not perfect many doctor have suspected that i have narcolepsy but my insurance company wont pay for the sleep study because im only in my s what anyway my doctor prescribed adderall because i simply could not stay awake in class driving riding the bus watching movie doing homework etc basically everything i remember the first dose i took i felt like a normal person not hyper or overstimulated my doc wa worried about this because i also have bipolar i just normal i just went about my day and did my homework and washed the dish and read a book like a normal person this drug ha really changed my life i gave it an because i still have to take nap throughout the day
147,prozac,im and ive had anxiety and some bad panic attack for the past year im prescribed ativan lorazapam to take a needed it helped a lot for traveling and definitely for shutting down panic attack but it also give you a lot of ups and down it a benzo so it essentially just shuts you down and make you pas out it doesnt really help fix the problem i talked to my doctor this summer about getting on an every day anxiety medicine and my mom take prozac so i thought maybe itll help me too i started at for a month and then increased to for month i can honestly say i havent had bad side effect at all but also it just felt like it wasnt doing anything i just recently increased to this month hoping for the best
148,fluoxetine,i started generic brand of prozac more than year ago i started at mg and am still on that same dose before prozac i lost almost pound because i didnt eat i wa depressed and always anxious i wa afraid of weird thing like taking a shower because i thought i would fall and die i wa afraid to win the lottery never would happen anyway lol i never had anything like this in my life i wa newly wed and just had baby so i guess it wa normal to have those feeling prozac ha been great first few week on it i had increased anxiety worse thing is i gained about pound
150,fluoxetine,i have been on prozac for about year im a small person about ft tall pound i take mg every other day my doctor say this dosage is a placebo but i highly disagree i use to suffer from mild sometimes not so mild depression never have had it while i have been on prozac it just cut off strong emotion no rage no cry and sometimes no feeling this is the only problem i am basically numb on emotion i only cry when thing really hit me hard it ha to be hard i must say i love alcohol on prozac it only take one drink to lighten me up this drug ha been a life saver

157,alprazolam,i have taken xanax now for six month and it ha been the best six month in a long time i have finally been able to go out in place where before i absolutely would not go for fear of panic attack i wa on mg ativan and mg tranxene before and all i did wa stay in my house and sleep thank goodness my doctor prescribed xanax
158,alprazolam,this wa the first medication i wa prescribed for anxiety panic attack post traumatic stress disorder and a few other problem i had going on at the same time i started taking mg once per day then mg twice per day this worked well for quite a while then i changed to mg once per day and after several month went to mg twice per day i took this for about yr total and had no nightmare seldom had racing thought the panic attack stopped pretty much all together after the first week or two and this also kept the general anxiety at bay a well the only problem wa that if you have no insurance or discount card it very expensive i had to go to mg valium x daily at the cost but wish i could still afford the xrs because they work well
159,fluoxetine,im still trying to find a medication that work for me but this is one that the doctor prescribed me about two year ago and i took it for very close to a year it did not help they kept adding more dosage until finally i quit seeing my psychiatrist altogether and stopped taking the medication

205,alprazolam,this medication ha been a wonderful aid to help me get my life back i suffer from panic attack a well a depression and it had gotten to the point that i wa fearful of everything then year ago my doctor put me on xanax of course it isnt the medicine alone that ha made the difference i have also treated my depression and started therapy everything together ha helped me actually enjoy life xanax isnt the right medication for everyone it is quick acting which make it great for panic attack but also ha a very short half life which make it not always a ideal for generalized anxiety there is the risk for dependency but a long a you take it a prescribed and stay honest with your doctor the risk is very low
207,fluoxetine,admittedly when i started prozac and up until i stopped taking it i wa not very honest with my therapist on my emotional state so i never changed medication despite it lack of effect on me i wa taking it to help with my depression and anxiety and it didnt help with either it didnt have any negative effect on me but it didnt have any positive effect either i had started at mg went up to mg and finally mg for each one it seemed to help at first but wouldnt after around two week although it wasnt right for me i know that it been quite helpful to friend of mine and it wouldnt hurt to try it out yourself
208,xanax,this med helped me to go back to a stressful job after am so grateful to have had this to deal with stressi wa able to function not get panicked or be exhausted by the stressful work in a hospitalmg per day wa so helpful
209,alprazolam,this is an absolutely wonderful medication xanax along with mg of prozac ha given me my life back no more insane panic attack and no more not being able to sleep take no more than what the doctor say to take in one day
210,xanax,i wa prescribed these for an onset of panic attack that would spike my bp to over taking these mg pill did nothing but make me lose my short term memory i still felt panicked and my bp would only drop slightly until i rode out the attack
211,alprazolam,this drug is just about the best thing that ever happened to me without it my panic attack would have crippled me totally by now i feel panic coming on take a pill and i am so very calm within minute no side effect and the best part is you dont have to take it regularly taken like an aspirin for a headache and work great
212,alprazolam,my psychiatrist prescribes me xanax mg per month i have generalized anxiety disorder and depression and am on other med for that xanax is only for extrastressful situation it is incredibly effective within minute of taking it i am much calmer i notice no side effect whatsoever
213,sarafem,i wa given sarafem to help with moodiness and rage during a few week out of the month i took it for day and can not get off the couch i am so drowsy i took a low dosage
214,xanax,in i started having what i now know panic attack but didnt know it at the time my doctor sent my blood in for testing trying to figure out why im having to pull over when driving cuz i think im going to pas out due to hyperventilation first i thought i wa having low blood sugar but a few week later at my follow up appt my doctor said quot youre having major panic attack i believequot i tried every anxiety medication there is trying to feel my dr gave me mg alpazolam every hour a needed i still take xanex and mg of lexapro to this day just having a xanex bar in my pocket help prevent attack today i get mg bar and i make sure i try to take no xanex a few time a week so i dont become dependent
216,alprazolam,i have been taking a combination of mg xanax time a day mg extended release xanax once daily and mg klonopin twice daily i have found that this combination of medication and xanax itself ha helped me get my mind back on the thing that matter in my life get over my fear and make an enormous amount of friend in my life although the only problem is that my doctor now tell me after month of taking this dose that he think the depakote mg a day is helping me and that he is going to start taking me off the benzodiazapines i tried to see if i would be able to get off of them and live normally i found myself worse than before the medication with severe withdrawal symptom
217,adderall xr,my son is and wa diagnosed with adhd and bipolar disorder when he wa we have tried many medication but the one to gave the most focus and changed his quality of life ha been adderall xr we immediately notice his lack of focus and hyperactivity level change if he is late taking his medicine
218,fluoxetine,i started to take prozac several month back to get off effexor it really made that transition smooth i take mg every other day i find it help with anxiety but not enough to wean off klonopin i know im normally over social and prozac make me antisocial i dont mind because im only antisocial with people i dont need to be associated with i believe my ability to orgasm ha improved from effexor to prozac i tend to sleep more than i should but it better than tossing and turning my motivation is at an all time low right now i dont know if it the prozac or work i gained weight initially but it coming off slowly and evening out i would recommend prozac it not a feelingresponsibility numbing a others med
222,alprazolam,a soon a i started taking xanax i started to feel much better i have had anxiety and panic attack for year and xanax ha really helped me i have had zero side effect from taking it so far going well
223,fluoxetine,it didnt work i wa up to mg daily and felt literally nothing ever since i had my son i have had panic attack and bad anxiety so i went to the doctor and wa prescribed prozac i wa so disappointed i almost feel more depressed now
225,alprazolam,i used to be prescribed this drug when i wa about i wa taken off it because the doctor said it can be addicting it really helped me get through my panic attack they switched me to xanax im just on paxil now my father take alprazolam once a day and it help him along with therapy
226,alprazolam,i had real bad panic attack so bad i thought i wa going crazymy doctor put me on zanax and i feel so much better i wa afraid to leave my house afraid to shop i would start to shop all of a sudden i had to run out the much more thing were happeningbut thanks to zanax i am calm cool and collectiveoh and sooooo happy
227,fluoxetine,i took mg of prozac from age to for depression and anxiety to make sure my condition didnt interfere with finishing high school and college it got rid of my anxiety and depression percent the only negative for me were that this dose made me hyperactiveharder to concentrate harder to orgasm and caused some emotional numbness where it wa harder to feel in love
229,fluoxetine,i should have been on this sooner im a year old recent law school graduate enduring the bar exam unfortunately twice my first round of studying i wa cry daily couldnt sleep wa irritable extremely depressed anxious i am normally these thing but it wa heightened by the bar exam my first time taking the exam i didnt come close to finishing the exam on the second day i wa cry and couldnt control my panic attack second round of studying for the test i decided to see a psychiatrist who gave me prozac i love it i feel like a normal person a better version of who i wa i feel even i dont have panic attack dont cry i feel great
230,fluoxetine,clencing of the jaw and bladder irritation are severe sideffects i have been having since starting fluoxetine most if perimenapausal symptom diminished however side effect are quite severe
231,xanax,i am prescribed to take two xanax a day but in reality i only take it when i am having a panic attack or feeling very tense or unhappy it work better for anxiety and tension then it doe depression a far a i can tell but then again i dont take it consistently
232,alprazolam,it is a good medicine i often find that it help me even more because i do not have to take it everyday
233,prozac,they bumped me up from mg to mg i have strong depression and anxiety but this is a great medicine for anxiety i do not think i will need klonopin anymore
234,fluoxetine,it a miracle drug i took this for anxiety and panic attack and slight depression it ha changed my life i am happier i have made more friend in the past month it ha helped with everything school stress anxiety and self confidence i cant recommend it enough
235,adderall xr,i am year old over the last year i have pretty muched ruined most of my relationship involving my career and my personal life the most common symptom i experience are difficulty concentrating and staying on task caprishious behaviorsevere mood swing impulsive behaviormaking irrational decision that significantly impact my future depression and anxiety i had a great job and i had lot of friend unfortunately difficult event took place that caused my emotional health to start spiraling out of control i became diagnosed with addadhd in april started addrerall mg xr it really helped me feel more motivated le depressed and i felt i could concentrate much better i definitely recommend this medication
237,fluoxetine,been suffering from depression most of my life ive been on zoloft and lexapro i would change when one seemed to stop working so went to prozac big mistake see the side effect i had almost every one of them doctor couldnt figure out what wa wrong till my wife showed them the side effect almost died lost in about week will never go back to it but who know it might work for you just didnt for me
238,xanax xr,this medication is amazing mostly because it start working immediately and you dont have to wait a few week like with other medicine my doctor had me taking it regularly for two month until my lexapro and seroquel kicked in and then weaned me off of it i now take it only every once in a while
239,fluoxetine,it always a test of one person everyone will have antidepressant that work best for them i tried lexapro and wellbutrin i hated wellbutrin prozac gave me zero side effect no sexual frustration no irritability and no insomnia im on my th month and just got bumped from mg to mg because of seasonal depression and feel a huge deal better ive lost lb in week because my appetite and drinking are also under control ive also heard prozac is associated with weight loss if something isnt working for you give it a try
240,alprazolam,i suffered idio pathic seizure begining when i wa about year old no lesion on my brain then came the panic attack i wa always hyper a well a my entire family i thought it wa quotnormalquot never understood how others where so quotcalmquot i became a hair stylist and began to make lot of money goergous womenyes i am straighthowever the attack kept on coming i moved from to miami finally i wound up at a clinic the shrink gave me a little pink pill and for the first time in my lifei felt like everyone else i am now year old if it werent for xanaxi would be searching for illegal alternative warning never take more than prescribed something year later i never abuse also dont mix it with anything
241,prozac,i have only been on prozac for day i havent had any irritable moment like i normally do but that could just be normal for me i am anxious about the side effect and anxious to know if this is going to help me i am year old and have suffered from ocd and anxiety for year i have never taken anything for it i just thought it wa something i could control on my own but came to the realization that i cant control everything now i am just waiting to see what happens and if this wonder drug will work for me
244,adderall,do not take adderall if high blood pressure run in your family be especially careful not to take it if you have high blood pressure already i had normal blood pressure until i started taking adderall ever since my blood pressure ha been at least and i have measured it at while on the drug i am a year old male and my dad ha hypertension which is where this incredible susceptibility come from i stopped taking it but i still have high reading which only started when i began taking adderall do yourself a big favor and harangue your doctor about adderall if you or your family ha a history of high blood pressure you dont want to end up on bp med
245,adderall,i could not get out of bed without adderall i have been taking it since however i developed a severe spinal disease fibro and arthritis i had to give in to taking pain med which interfered with my adderall dosage i currently take mg i have found this dose ineffective for the past several year my family doctor prescribes my med and doesnt feel comfortable titrating up to mg i weigh mg a well i am frustrated and feel exhausted most of the day
247,xanax,xanax made me a normal person again i had bout of anxiety seemingly my entire life but it didnt become debilitating until i reached my s and became overwhelmed with everything on my plate and i lost sight of who i wa i couldnt focus on anything because i wa too worried about school and work and my health issue it became too much and i dropped out of school with a anxiety stole my life away but xanax gave me the strength to gain it back im finally about to graduate have a wonderful job and just recently got engaged i am a normal person and i thank anxiety for calming my brain and enabling me to live a beautiful productive life i highly recommend it if you genuinely suffer from debilitating anxiety
248,alprazolam,im currently on alprazolammg a day ive been diagnosed with severe anxiety and panic disorder afraid of dying threw my experience because of my symptom which are rapid heart beat trouble breathing sweaty foot or clammy hand nausea trembling trouble sleeping going out to do anything became an issue too socializing and even faint dizzy pure fear of death this ha conflicted with my wife child job and my entire life period xanax ha given me my life back in full and am currently regaining my life back
251,alprazolam,i started having panic attack year ago when going through death in the family and the ending of my marriage to being a single mom i just could not cope with it any longer i cant tell you the trip to the er just to be gave a lorazepam my doctor tried other benzos but they just did not help the sudden attack they have upped my dose but at this point xanax is a life saver and i dont know what i would do without them the only draw back is the half life they wear off to soon and i will not take another dose until time to take it again those few hour are not good but and milligram a day is far a i will take this i have been on benzodiazepine for three year and that scare me but not like the panic attack those make you feel like your having a heartattack or worse i have had some that i really did not think i wa going to live through so my xanax stay until i can get off them when the stress is gone and a taper off never suddenly go off them it could be very dangerous a taper down is best but from what i have heard it not pleasant
254,adderall xr,i have been on adderall for several year now and cant say enough good thing about the medicine it help me to focus on task and now that i am in college it ha really helped with my study it took me a while to come to the realization that i needed something to help with my add and i am glad i wa prescribed adderall the side effect for me have been loss of appetite i would have insomnia but i take antianxiety medicine before going to bed to counteract the medication my short and unscientific philosophy on adderall is that it bridge the gap between wanting to do something and actually doing something
255,adderall xr,this medicine is not to be taken lightly it help very much
258,xanax,any drug can get a bad wrap because of some people abusing it a lot of doctor dont even like prescribing xanax because they dont want their patient getting quothookedquot for me i suffer from occasional anxiety attack and my prescription is quota neededquot anxiety attack can be very scary there were a few time i literally thought i wa gon na die it wa that bad i even went to the er once because i believed i wa having a heart attack they are different for different people i use to smoke and drink a lot of coffee so i think thats what screwed up my body chemistry i dont drink caffeine or smoke anymore all i know is that now that i have my alprazolam xanax in my pocket im not a scared to go place i can live my life again
259,fluoxetine,started th of may so hasnt been long suffered severe postnatal depression with youngest child year ago got over that and have been fine up until recently i had a miscarriage over christmas and over the month following found myself getting very low again but most of all noticed the anxiety hypochondria and irritation doctor put me mg fluoxetine a day and seems to be good so far definately le anxiety but also definately lack of energy and i have tiredness no matter how much sleep i get i feel like a zombie in the morning and yawn a lot until i have some coffee my sense of humour libido and appetite have decreased but i am putting that down to cant be bothered feeling sticking with it for now give hangover from hell too
260,xanax,in a case of emergency i would take xanax during the day but i usually take it at night to go to bed and to stop the anxiety and panic attack it make me feel so sleepy i dont know how anyone can take it during the day i felt high a a kite it work thats for sure
261,niravam,i suffer from combat related ptsd depression and panic attack have been taking ativan for several year with wellbutrin sr i still take the ativan to control the anxiety but since my doctor added niravam it seems a soon a it dissolve on my tongue i can feel almost immediate relief and it stop the panic attack in no time at all it truly a miracle medication
262,prozac,i wa prescribed the generic form of prozac and at week my depression became more severe i began feeling hopeless worse i have felt in a very long time im glad to hear that most people find improvement but wanted to share my experience
263,xanax,all started when i wa about year young all typical symptom racing thought palpitation high blood pressure dizzines fear choking feeling chest tightness fear of death and many other unbearable thing which happens when anxiety becomes uncontrollable over the year i have had my good day and my bad day sometimes to a point where i dont want to live anymore but then come good day and to live is the thing i want the most for those dark moment when close to panic xanax ha really helped me it get me a bit calmer straight away and then i can start breathing excercise and other little thing which help to calm down without xanax i honestly wouldnt know what to do
264,xanax,wa prescribed this by the va after retiring from the military am new to it but it make my life so much better have had horrible panic and anxiety attack for year even before i knew what they were driving meeting interacting in group you name it so far so good it really help
267,xanax,i started taking xanax at age and it wa a great medicine i had such bad panic attack and just constant anxiety i started out on a low dose and within min i felt calm and fine i got from the place of not being able to walk outside or answer the phone to being able to get married have a job go on vacation anything i wanted to do i wa normal but now im and on the highest dose mg a day and about year ago my horrible anxiety came back even though im taking it i cant work drive or really go anywhere anymore so i guess id say it work but then you may build up a tolerance and then it wont work
268,alprazolam,i have taken this for a chronic stuttering problem it ha lessened my anxiety anxiousness and depressive mood in speech situatuions a well a daily stress due to being fast acting it ha been my experience this is the better of the many antidepressant and antianxiety drug i have not found it addictive and have had no side effect
269,fluoxetine,a renowned medication to help pmdd but barely helped me helped with my anxiety and depression quite well despite lack of emotion but always got hormonal monthly which wa confusing it actually made some symptom worse on lexapro now so hopefully that help
270,alprazolam,i have been on xanax for about year now i have suffered with anxiety since i wa a child and depression later in life i started out only taking mg a day even going for period of time without taking it at all and then over the past year i have graduated to only mg a day i feel no need for an increase i suffer with all the usual anxiety symptom but one symptom that is most annoying is the choking sensation i feel in my throat i believe i carry my stress and worry there when i take xanax it take this terrible feeling away i find it extremely difficult to get a doctor to prescribe me this medicine a i moved to another state the people who abuse this drug make it extremely difficult for those of u who need it
271,fluoxetine,i took this with bupropion i stopped bupropion because i wa so edgy and irritable it wa suggested i wait for prozac to take full effect in about month i stopped prozac last night after a week of it alone i wa edgy irritable and didnt feel like doing productive thing like care about my job or care about studying on investing choice i just wanted to take a nap to relieve the buzzing in my head today i am not taking anything i feel better than yesterday
273,alprazolam,i mostly used xanax when i had an altercation verbal with my girlfriend she would overreact and a a result i would get so charged up that i couldnt switch back to normal taking xanax eased my nerve so that i could quotstart newquot with the conversation very powerful though and last a long time i took dos of mg im lb if semianxious dos made me very tired i blackedout for part of a night when taking mg memory of stuff that happened felt like memory of dream also cancel out adhd stimulant medication
274,xanax,i have been on a fairly high dose of this medication for over year now i can not tell you enough that it is an extremly horrible idea for long term use time daily or more or even le any long term use of this drug to me is almost a death sentence for that person it is probably the most difficult thing to stay off of if used for more then a month or straight im trying to get off them now myself but i am so very deep in a hole it almost hard to see the end once you stop say goodbye to sleep for a while and feeling like complete psychosis for the next few week or month till your brain come back from the hole you dug for it if i could go back and never take a benzo i would in a heart beat ssri and ssnris never worked for me
275,fluoxetine,suffered from anxiety for many year mostly social anxiety that resulted in panic attack tried therapy breathing technique relaxing workout eating healthy i really wanted to avoid medication at all cost i wa repeatedly missing work due to the fatigue of stress and decided to take my doctor advice at this time my immune system wa poor my skin wa horrible and my whole body ached i started prozac mg once a day and have been taking it for day i did not have any bad reaction or nausea my mood is significantly better my skin is better i am performing well at work i feel happy to communicate with others and i do not have panic attack anymore a daily happening before i feel so much better
276,alprazolam,i have been using this med on and off for year for insomnia i use mg dose it is very effective for me to get to sleep and even if you wake up in the night you can fall right back to sleep plus if you dream you may have only positive dream no bad situation dream at least that is my experience other overthecounter sleep aid give me that hang over feeling in the morning not alprazolam xanax used occasionally it is a good choice
278,alprazolam,not only doe a mg shut down racing thought and anxiety it reduces depression been on every other antidepressant out there with awful side effect dont need to take it every day
279,xanax,i wa prescribed mg of xanax for my hyperanxiety and panic attack a a lb man i needed a mg dose xanax really solves panic attack well and noticeably help with my anxiety it make it much easier to fall asleep which is great at bedtime but can be a real problem in the morning reading quotfeeling goodquot by dr david burn also really helped treat the thought that led to panic and anxiety
281,amphetamine,i have bipolar i disorder with psychotic and depressive feature and a diagnosis of adhd i take med for all three condition i take vyvanse mg in the am when that ware off i take evekeo mg twice every hour pm i also take my stimulant with ativan a i also have anxiety too evekeo is perfect for me it doesnt make me feel hyper nor doe it give me that high feeling it normalizes me and i can actually be driven and calm at the same time since i take two stimulant youre probably wondering how in the world all i can say is that vyvanse doesnt last all day long for me so i supplement with evekeo i take evekeo once vyvanse ware out im happy with them both

347,alprazolam,i have been taking xanax alprazolam in moderation for a few year i do not take it unless i feel extremely stressed which lead to depression although i take lexapro for depression and anxiety xanax is still needed for the severely stressful time it quickly calm my nerve and help me to not worry and stress so much about thing most people would not stress over it also help with my short temper overall it ha been helpful also i tend to forget what ive done or said or experienced while under the influence of xanax also i noticed it increase my appetite for notsohealthy food use with caution and moderation

359,xanax,i use xanax occasionally a required i feel relaxed in real sense feel increase in mental ability sleep well and when i wake up im in a very fresh mood
361,xanax,i began taking xanax at mg daily spread out over the day when diagnosed with breast cancer i have had it time now so have been on this medication for year it control my anxiety and panic or fearful thought mostly it been extremely helpful and my doctor know i keep my dosage a directed very beneficial for me but it took a long while to overcome the stigma life is to valuable to waste feeling bad

365,fluoxetine,ive been taking prozac since i wa thirteen year old or so im sixteen now and im worried that if i ever stop ill get bad again i have severe anxiety and had depression the depression ha gone away but the anxiety ha worsened not from this medication but i believe i need a larger dose anyways this drug ha helped me and made me feel like it can get better knowing the chemistry in my brain is really helpful too to know that serotonin is being released i would recommend for severe depression but not anxiety unless at a larger dose im on mg now but took mg up until a month ago
366,adderall,i wa prescribed adderall xr mg six month ago after trying focalin xr and not liking it because of severe stomach pain it would give me before trying the adderall and focalin i wa diagnosed with adhd because i brought it to my doctor attention i had always had a problem in high school and even middle school with getting good grade everyone thought i wa lazy in college the situation wa getting worse and i started to get depressed about my bad grade i then realized my depression wa stemming from my inability to concentrate on school work it been six month since ive been on the adderall xr and my grade have shot up i get a and b in all my class and am so much more organized which help with everything in my life

369,fluoxetine,i wa on this medication for over week and it made me into an unemotional zombie my grandma literally passed away in front of me and i couldnt even shed a tear it helped get me moving around more but it wasnt really helping my depression i wasnt happy at all and my anhedonia still persisted also on top of all that prozac made me lose my libidosex drive even after i stopped taking it over week ago im scared my libidosex drive is never going to come back this is why i only rated this drug a
371,xanax,xanax may have saved my life in the early ninety i wa a young man pursuing my ambition career car and woman whatever i have done experienced led me to be violent in my reaction to asshole also mom raised me a she went through menopause and wa volatile i wa dangerously aggressive in my early s xnx worked with no side affect noticed sleepiness at first thats sought xnx because it made me feel like i should calm thus able to focus did well all these year i got laid off doc retired and i cant find a local doc to prescribe the system took it away clandestine alternative are expensive risking life limb and employment doc are ignorant sometimes
372,adderall,this drug work great at first until you need more and more to focus stay away from this med if you dont truly have adhd or you have hypertension
373,alprazolam,best medicine i have taken for panic disorder started may th and have not had a panic attack since want to start weaning off concerned about withdrawal symptom
374,prozac,worked for about a month then i started sleeping hour a night and lost all motivation
375,xanax,xanax is amazing in i wa overwhelmed with emotion my mother had a stroke in march of that year and at the same time me and my wife were expecting our st child all these emotion led to me having depression and anxiety i wa finally diagnosed in with anxiety disorderpanic attack they prescribed me xanax mg one a day and it work miracle in my daily life
376,xanax,so many other review on here but this drug is important i will chime in a well since it ha been prescribed a little different for me i used to wake up in a panic a couple of time a week but it pretty easy for me to gauge my stress level and predict which night are going to be bad one i take or mg or night a week before am or ill be so zonked i dont respond to my alarm it doe the trick so i can fall right back to sleep after waking instead of panicking and then ruminating for hour and being a mess at work and with my kid the next day it work so well amp i can easily see how it would be addictive but it a lifechanger so i am very careful
377,xanax,it so great to have something that finally work for me it fast acting and take away my insane thought and brings me back to reality quickly my worry go away and i can feel like a normal person ive been on ativan clonazapam and paxil and effexor in my younger day the ativan did nothing the clonazapam wa ok but is much better for sleep the paxil and effexor were nightmare and had horrible side effect i would never take that kind of medication again i take mg xanax when i get an attack or intrusive thought and it the best thing for me i become a rational thinking person again and couldnt be happier to have something that really work it really improved my life
378,fluoxetine,i have had major depressive dissorder since i wa year of age had pretty much come to term with the fact that this wa going to be lifelong thing been to therapy group and tried other med like regular amp generic prozac plus took paxil for a little while prozac weekly ha been the only thing that ha made a huge difference for me other than being very careful about eating healthy i forget to take daily med so only taking it once a week is a bonus the first time i took prozac weekly it took about week to really quotkick inquot but once it did the difference wa like night amp day is this how normal people feel you mean i can feel like this everyday not sure if it will be the same for you just my positive experience good luck
379,alprazolam,before i wa prescribed xanax i weighed pound bag under my eye couldnt get out of bed had no appetite dehydrated couldnt leave the house or even speak to anyone i have severe anxiety and depression amp also suffer from ptsd thought on suicide were everyday and i had to be basically babysat to make sure i didnt do anything stupid i dont understand why everyone talk about the negative effect of this pill when people like me actually need it to function and live a happy lifestyle since taking it ive gained healthy weight no longer throw up from anxiety i have friend now and do activity i never thought i would without having panic attack it a great feeling to be able to live again thank you xanax
380,xanax xr,i used to live with severe panic attack and overall always full of medication work so well that i feel very normal nightmare shaking nausea panicking sweaty and restless feeling and anxiety all highly recommend this medication for people who genuinely need a benzodiazapene to regulate the central nervous sure you dont abruptly stop taking them though a you will feel extremely ill do keep your dr informed of any side are pretty mild however can cause weight gain and lower sex drive
381,alprazolam,this is the best to knock a panic attack flat on it arse i been taking mg daily for month and i also take them when i fly i could literally walk on the wing and not care dont take with alcohol thoughi made the mistake of popping one of these then drank or martini i made a fool of myself and swung from a coworkers chandelier at a party and pulled it out of the ceiling everyone wa cheering me on so i felt like a bru the more i drank the stupider i became at the end of the night i climbed a street pole and tried to punch out the light telling people it wa a ufo they work well but do not drink on them
383,prozac,ive been hesitant try prozac a i didnt want to be a zombie or overly sedated but after year of dealing with panic disordergeneralized anxiety and countless antidepressant not working i decided to give it a try the first month wa pretty rough i wa always tired brain wa foggy and i continued to have anxiety but i stuck with it and after increasing to mg i felt absolutely normal i could feel emotion and even a normal amount of anxiety without freaking out it ha also helped with social anxiety downside i find it almost impossible to get any deep sleep on this medicine and no sleep medicine seems to work ive tried them all
384,fluoxetine,i took mg prozac from age to to make sure my anxiety and depression didnt interfere with being successful in high school and college the mg completely got rid of my anxiety and depression this dose however wa too stimulating causing loopiness decreased concentration in conversation hyperactivity and extended laughing spell over silly thing this dose also made it very difficult to orgasm and numbed up my emotion where it wa difficult to feel whether i wa in love with someone or not when dating i did not realize these side effect until i finally got off prozac at age could feel my emotion and discover my true personality off med orgasm great now
385,fluoxetine,i started this in the hospital at after a few day they upped it to i felt weird the first week or so then somewhat normal i didnt have an appetite for the first couple of week the major side effect ha been insomnia i woke up at or in the morning i dont fall alseep because i have to get up at and my spouse will get up at am ive taking my son to school and then coming home and sleeping i tired tea melatonin and some liquid sleep aid but morning ha worked to help sleep through the night i dont want to take another medication
386,prozac,life saver at first made me feel tired but now i have energy and more out going
387,alprazolam,i wa diagnosed with a severe panic disorder that literally took over my life i wa prescribed xanax mg it is my life saver i feel like my old self and i look forward to getting up in the morning i wa petrified of getting the panic attack and this medication ha helped and it work within minute of taking it i have had reduced attack and feel so much better the only downside is you feel a little bit drowsy and if you are late taking it on time i found i would get severe blurred vision it usually passed within a few hour you definitely have to take it on time
388,alprazolam,xanax ha seriously saved my life i wa having very bad anxiety that wa affecting my digestive system my stomach hurt everyday all day long for about a year along with diarrhea i went to the doctor and they ran a bunch of test but nothing wa wrong these stomach problem affected my daily life i couldnt go anywhere or do anything which wa causing me to be depressed my doctor then prescribed me xanax every time i start feeling anxious i take one and now have no stomach problem
389,prozac,i wa put on fluoxetine mg daily due to a particularly bad bout of depression that left me unable to work or even get out of bed that wa over a year ago and it wa a godsend i started on mg and increased to within a month close to no side effect some stomach pain and the relief of my depression happened within the first week after a month and a half on it i wa feeling great and alive again it wa amazing after month on the medication i decided to wean off that went well however anxiety started building up again i believe my condition ha now changed i wa put back on fluoxetine mg but felt no relief of my anxiety whatsoever and had to add ativan to my regimen i am now exploring other option but it wa great
390,adderall,started adderall week ago i am still trying to find the right dose doctor said quotstart with mg morning and afternoon but if thats to much take mg morning and afternoonquot im finding if i take mg and my day is really busy i am fine but if my day is not than i notice my heart rate and a need to be doing something im not sure about this medicine yet but willing to give it a little more time i just want to know if the feeling of needing to be busy will end
391,xanax xr,i had no good effect from other benzodiazepine to control my panic attack and i wa on xanax since im now and im on mg xr and x mg instant release a day my dose may need to get upped now and then but now i feel good havent had a panic attack in a while it doesnt make me tired or anything im basically on mg a day just different type of it and it work great i recommend it but im afraid to come off it
392,prozac,ive been on prozac mg since almost month for having severe depression and suicidal thought and death scenario i just want to say that this medicine is a life savior it work miracle regardless the fact of having so much dizziness especially when working out but thought get more positive by time
394,alprazolam,taking for gad highly recommend a long a you do not abuse it and only take it a prescribed start working in about minute only downside is wear off rather quickly for me but maybe thats because ive been taking it for so long you can quickly build up a tolerance which is a downside no negative side effect at all i honestly can not function without it be careful though i am not addicted to this medication but im totally dependent on it i guess i cant say thats a bad thing since it doing what it supposed to do which is help calm panic attack and keep my anxiety at a more tolerable level so i can function daytoday people like me who need it dont get a quothighquot from it
395,fluoxetine,first week wa hell more anxiety and panic attack had to leave work early one day for the anxiety also left a family event early but now starting second week and starting to feel like myself again a long a thing continue this way will be happy on this drug without the first week side effect would give it a
397,alprazolam,i have been on xanax mg tid since this ha been a miracle drug for my anxiety i also take celexa mg daily in combination with xanax within minute of taking my prescription i feel a tremendous amount of stress relief i normally take at bedtime and sleep straight through the night and never wake up groggy i feel refreshed each morning and get ready for work thumb up for this medication those that abuse it you give patient who truly suffer from anxiety and depression a bad name
398,prozac,if youre reading this youre probably wondering the same thing i waswhen will i get better feel normal again prozac ha brought me my life back im a yr old who ha struggled my whole life with clinical depression you name it anxiety nervousness paranoia i take mg a day paired with mg of adderall for my adhd i feel great and i can actually function now
399,alprazolam,have been taking for a few month now with great result little dosage changing i tried ssri and other medication without much luck other than feeling down or drained used trazadone for sleep i wa living like a zombie with xanax the sedation wore off after roughly day which wa the only thing i can complain off i have been doing better at school le worrisome tic better sleep instead of waking up screaming longer acting wa better for me than a rollercoaster ride of taking a lorazapam or xanax same dose worked wonderfully for year and now i just found that this time of my life i needed something longacting that i wouldnt have to think about my anxiety or worry about it anymore
401,fluoxetine,i wa put on prozac mg for severe ocd and anxiety year ago and took it for a little bit over a year and it helped tremendously i wa dumb and stopped taking it and over the course of month my ocd and anxiety slowly got worse to the point where i had been when i first started taking the medicine i just started back up on it about week ago and the first week on it wa bad for me i had lot of anxiety and suicidal thought but here recently im starting to notice some improvement in my anxiety dont stop taking prozac just because you feel better i found out the hard way and it not worth it
402,fluoxetine,ive been on prozac on and off throughout my life ive been on it now for consecutive month and i must say that anxiety is a thing of the past i dont want to kill myself all the time either i also am le impulsive i smoke a lot though i do tend to have trouble feeling emotion sometimes this medicine is very powerful yet it seems subtle or unnoticeable while im on it but the period that i go off it i can easily see it dampening effect on the mind because thing become really clear perhaps too clear
403,xanax,after taking this medication i feel very tranquil i am an easy going person when i take it i am calm and i dont have that high feeling i hate i am coherent but calm no one really bother me it a miracle because before i used it my husband used to get on my nerve my kid would get under my skin at the grocery market i wanted to knock out someone but now i am a nice calm person that can be approached and even ha fun
406,fluoxetine,i started a very low dosage and worked upward until i found what worked for me mg however a my depression got worse and worse the prozac actually stopped working altogether no matter how much it wa increased it a good medicine for mild to moderate depression but there are better choice for major depression
407,adderall,this may be a little long so i hope you took your medicine today lol this is my rd month on adderall and it is absolutely a miracle drug for me i have suffered with extreme fatigue and excessive sleepiness since i wa a teenager im now my doctor have tried me on everything from sleeping pill to antidepressant nothing worked a friend suggested adderall i researched it talked to my doctor about it and we tried provigil first which did help but i wa still falling asleep driving reading etc switched to adderall i wa so happy i nearly cried when i wa telling my doctor how much better i feel i wish i would have tried this year ago
408,adderall,i am and have been on adderall for year i take mg twice a day it help me concentrate and stay focused i skip taking it for one day every week this help me see where the adderall help in my life and wa suggested by my doctor to help my body not build a tolerance to adderall at this time i personally dont believe adderall is quotaddictingquot when taken properly while on vacation i went a week without it and never felt any withdrawal from the adderall i keep my adderall and other med in a metal lock box that lock onto a shelf in my fridge because people do abuse adderall
409,prozac,admittedly when i started prozac and up until i stopped taking it i wa not very honest with my therapist on my emotional state so i never changed medication despite it lack of effect on me i wa taking it to help with my depression and anxiety and it didnt help with either it didnt have any negative effect on me but it didnt have any positive effect either i had started at mg went up to mg and finally mg for each one it seemed to help at first but wouldnt after around two week although it wasnt right for me i know that it been quite helpful to friend of mine and it wouldnt hurt to try it out yourself
410,prozac,prozac wa the worst for me wouldnt recommend it to anyone i wa using it for depression and anxiety and when i first started taking it i felt terrible stayed on it for another month or so till my psychiatrist who did absolutely nothing for me spent a total of minute with me in appts uped my dose to mg i started feeling really tired all the time got headache felt sick my head wa always foggy couldnt remember much drained me right out so without my doctor word i stopped taking it and i still feel depressed and anxious but i feel much more alive and much better prozac didnt work for me at all
411,adderall xr,ive been taking this medicine for about year now i think it is great i have been able to do better in school and focus more at work i am also able to sit still and not move around a much
413,fluoxetine,i am year old phd student i have been taking prozac for week now it started affecting me on the rd week i felt so much more active and i had hope for living i am working more efficiently and my sleep schedule is perfect i am gaining some weight which mean i should also start exercising i still have vivid dream and wake up several time during the night but i dont mind it because my life ha changed so much and i feel so happy after year of depression
415,fluoxetine,i started taking anti depressant after my grandchild died he wa year old and it changed my world i had so much anxiety over people and i wa just so sad and angry all of the time i stated celexa and i loved how it just shut off the bad eventually it wa increased and i couldnt stay awake for anything i got switched to prozac about a month ago at first i felt very irritable but thats gotten better and now i feel better overall no more trying to sleep all day and the crazy switch is still flipped to off
416,amphetamine,my child ha been on this almost a week and it ha made her worse in school and hyper i am looking forward to seeing the doctor this week the dose wa cut in half after being on it day and no change in behaviour still not able to focus and refuse all school work and became more defiant
417,adderall,against the advice of my teacher my mom decided not to medicate me a a kid since my grade were fine a i got older i got worse concentrating wa impossible for me and my grade dropped my mind never stopped i have been on adderall for almost year now this drug saved me it worked great the down sideafter this long i have built a tolerance get very irritable and feel kinda foggy or dazed by the end of the day im going to try something new for awhile and see what happens
418,xanax,xanax saved me apprehensive about taking med but broke down after it got so bad i didnt even want to take the cover off my head with my eye clenched shut just fearing every day because i knew anxiety fear of everything under the sun and panic attack would rule my day i wa told i needed to be on long term anxiety drug so i tried lexapro and ended up in the er with side effect so horrific i dont even want to think of it now xanax is basically a quick fix to calm the anxiety but it the only thing im willing to take and over time i broke out of the nightmare i wa living i still have bout of anxiety but a long a i have xanax on hand i know ill be ok i never had any bad side effect except for being tired trade is worth it
419,alprazolam,i have been taking xanax off and on for about year now it is great for anxiety i spent thousand of dollar going to the er thinking i wa having a heart attack before it wa brought to my attention that it wa actually anxiety i take mg a needed now i noticed that when i stopped taking it that i could not sleep for day and i became shaky at time and the anxiety return immediately the other thing that i notice is that after a while you become immune to the dosage if you only take it with the onset of an anxiety or panic attack it shouldnt be a problem
420,adderall,im yr old male and i started taking adderall for adult add month ago my physician and i decided to give it a shot because i wa having a terrible time at work yr employed doing the simple but long term tasksprojects that everybody else were doing on timecompleted pro productivity up more attention to detail finishing task major increase focusing easily major decrease in stress from cognitivelymentally draining myself in attempt to stay focused more energy con severe initial day side effect still experiencing severe dehydration dry mouth nausea dead libido moody increase in tobacco smoking loss of appetite fantastic benefit side effect are still mild if anything
421,adderall xr,i have been on everything from concerta to wellbutrin to vyvanse next to vyvanse adderall xr ha been the most helpful if i take it any later than noon i will absolutely have insomnia i also have to be careful about the food i eat and especially try to avoid my multivitamin in the morning because of the citric acid it doesnt decrease my appetite sometimes i feel like it increase it but it prevents me from bingeeating i take mg adderall xr with mg of zoloft and though it help with my ocd tendency that adderall is likely to cause i dont think the combination work a well a adderall xr by itself i will also occasionally have heart palpitation but thats usually a sign that i need to limit my coffee intake
423,alprazolam,i am so thankful for this medication it ha saved me countless trip to the er due to severe gripping panic attack it took about year of anxiety useless quottryingquot of several ssri and dozen of trip to the hospital hyperventilating shaking screaming with my pulse approaching before a smart doctor finally prescribed me xanax i take the medication on an asneeded basis and sparingly i take mg half pill to prevent anxiety attack when anticipating an panicinducing situation i take mg at the first sign an attack is starting the quickest most effective route is to lightly crush the pill with your teeth and let it dissolve beneath your tongue my experience with xanax is pretty much identical to that of ativan
424,alprazolam,my doctor threw every anti depressant medication my way they all made my depression worse to the point i had suicidal thought and tendency my mother had it with the drs changing my dose and med so finally she gave me some of her own prescribed xanax she gave me a when i had my bad day about day out of the month now a needed i also have nervous habit anxiety when she started giving me the xanax i wa before i would cry hysterically for hour on end a soon a i tried xanax it all went away no more mood swing my depression went way down only having a few issue a month when i wa untreated i am now and i use it maybe time a year and i use oil the others i highly recommend not using it continuously
425,fluoxetine,incredible to think a simple pill would be so life changing year old married mother of two ive been struggling with depression and anxiety especially social anxiety my entire life i wa at the end of my rope starting to think depression wasnt even a real thing it wa just normal to feel like shit literally the first day i felt okay a month later here i am exercising everyday in my spotless house and playing with my kid no more emotional eating ive lost fifteen freaking pound i have the energy and focus to do everything i only wish i would have tried it sooner i thought it would make me feel like a numb robot but i still feel like me just a better me really looking forward to my future on prozac
426,adderall,i have had problem my whole life with school holding down job depression and alcoholism adderall ha changed my life i am and i finally have the courage to pursue the career i didnt think i would be able to do before i also take prozac the combination doe make me a little dizzy and i do sweat a lot more but the miracle of being able to function on a daily basis and concentrate out way the side effect
427,fluoxetine,ive been taking this now for about six week at first it worked well but for the last two week it seems to have stopped working ive been taking ten tablet a day for the last day thats mg daily of fluoxetine and it doe nothing im going to call my doctor and ask to try something else
428,fluoxetine,i wa prescribed this drug for panic disorder and wa on it for week i have never felt wise in my entire life i did bit eat or drink unless forced spiraled into depression and just wa not the excited loving person i normally am i world go home and state at the wall for hour then crawl into bed and sleep i had nightmare each night i felt dead and like i wa floating above my body my friend and teacher became more worried than before i had to get off that pill
429,fluoxetine,i have always had anxiety however about month ago i began to have panic attack walking to the shop by myself walking to work i thought i wa going to pas out it wa awful then one day i just couldnt walk to work i got half way then i wa convinced i wa going to faint so walked home i then realized how out of control my anxiety had become my partner went with me the doctor prescribed me mg tablet once a day the first week my anxiety wa definitely heightened it felt like i wa losing the plot however within a month i found myself walking to the shop and work feeling fine i havent had a panic attack for over month i wish i had started this medication sooner i now feel normal again
433,fluoxetine,i took prozac for about five month i felt buoyant for the first six week then le so after three month or so my mood wa down and my finger were stiff and painful upon waking after four month both hand and foot were in pain and did not function for an hour after waking the condition persisted in an everdiminishing form for five year after discontinuation of the medicine i am told that my reaction wa rare nevertheless it happened to me
434,alprazolam,i have social and generalized anxiety along with panic attack i am at a max dose of mg time per day this medication is a life saver in the term of allowing me to not be afraid around myself allowing me to go out and socialize with friend the only downside is i will most likely be on this medication the rest of my life a it ha proven to be extremely addictive both physically and psychologically your brain naturally creates gaba which take up to a year or longer to start creating on it own this medicine also wipe out your shortterm memory and tolerance is a huge problem along with creating more extreme panic attack if a dose is missed however this medication is a life safer for me year and counting
435,fluoxetine,i have my life back now pmdd used to make me suffer with so many symptom and anxiety it felt like i wa in a haze for many day of month and it wa like clockwork each month now i barely notice any symptom it took a couple of month to see the full affect no side effect a of yet on mg daily
436,xanax,i wa year old when my family doctor prescribed me xanax mg for my stress and anxiety from work and life at the time im now i only take it when im under a lot of stress or when my anxiety level go up in any situation in my life at the same time when im stressed out i go walking and running because it help too i wouldnt know what i would do if i didnt have xanax to help me
439,prozac,i have been on prozac mg for week now i feel super great i wa taking xanax too but i feel i dont need to take my xanax any more prozac ha been working for me just great the first week i wa feeling terrible anxiety numbness in my face dry mouth fear it wa crazy but at day th i started to feel more focused so now it been week and i feel how i used to feel before just great so please just hang in there give prozac at least week to kick in
440,fluoxetine,i have been taking prozac for at least year and it help keep me from being irritated all the time when i have not taken it for a couple of day i get what i call quotpermanent road ragequot ready to snap at the world
441,alprazolam,i get severe anxiety even to go to the store i would not feel comfortable eating in public just to leave my house my anxiety over whelmes me so much costing me to the point i will isolate myself from public then came along xanax and did it job what it supposed to do and all the nightmare anxiety went all away yes it is addictive but it work magic in my opinion it like a god sent medicine for people like me with extreme anxiety and insomnia i tried vistruil and others didnt help like xanax
442,prozac,i have been on prozac now for a while a i suffer from ocd and ptsd also i feel a if it ha made me crazier if thats possible some day i cant stop twitching feel full of energy and experience nausea other day my bone hurt i feel not fully awake and just odd keeping in mind that daily i have a high level of caffeine and smoke marijuana and not daily but weekly i drink quite a bit of alcohol i have noticed alcohol and prozac really dont mix but nevertheless i am still taking mg daily which i do not think is enough but then some day i want to stop taking it altogether i do not although prozac dos shouldnt be skipped but evidently the only word i can use to describe this drug is odd and weird and idk uugh
444,fluoxetine,i wa placed on the generic of prozac week ago i have social anxiety always have and my doctor told me that it wa related to an ocddepression and could possibly be ptsd all of this confused me but made sense at the same time because i have always suspected all of these she told me prozac would greatly help with my anxiety problem since being on prozac the only change i have really noticed are extreme fatigue during the day lessened appetite which is good because i have been overeating for a while and i feel like it ha helped my relationship a bit i dont seem to get a agitated a fast but i have bad day sometimes i do however feel like i zone out a lot now and forget what im saying sometimes
447,fluoxetine,i started taking mg prozac for day on the nd day my whole body ached like the flu and my throat is sore i took tylenol for the body ache and pretty much slept the whole day around am i started vomitting up bile until am cold sweat clammy and shaking my dr told me to stop taking the prozac but my body still ache so bad
449,adderall,for extreme fatigue i have taken adderall mg a day for month with occasional missing a day it give me great energy negates my fatigue and seam to asuages a slight depression
451,xanax,only thing that keep me sane and under my own control
452,alprazolam,ive taken xanax for year for occassional insomia for the past year ive been battling with high blood pressure along with some new health issue that popped up for the last two week my heart ha been racing and my stomach ha had butterfly i really felt like hiding under the cover and didnt know why i kept wondering why am i so afraid lying in bed watching tv i felt a though my heart wa about to just rip itself out of my chest so i decided to take a xanax during the day and it wa like a miracle cure hopefully the panic attack wont last forever but thank god i had something to help
454,prozac,after year on duloxetine for major depression and degenerative osteoarthritis a new psyche doctor had me try effexor terrifying effect bad trip he had been having me take prozac while i wa weaning off duloxetine because it mitigates the withdrawal syndrome from duloxetine and i felt better than i had in year after the nearsuicide because of effexor i asked if we could just stick with prozac but increase the dose i prefer it because i feel like me not some druggedout flattenedemotion version of me i still can get happy sad mad chill relaxed etc many antidepressant eliminate that ability which i find unbearable personally i take mg once per day in the morning and it ha given me my life back again
455,alprazolam,i use this infrequently but it been effective each time i take for anxiety and high stress situation but also to calm my brain so i can get a good night sleep work fast and slows me down but in a good way
456,fluoxetine,for those of you worrying about taking fluoxetine i hope this will help ive been having crippling panic attack for the last month and i wa diagnosed with general anxiety disorder by my gp then a consultant psychiatrist ive tried cbt during this time which helped explain about what my body wa doing releasing large amount of adrenaline fight or flight response etc but it didnt really help i also managed to convince myself that fluoxetine which i wa prescribed early on could make thing worse following some suicidal thought i decided what the hell it cant be any worse and i took my first mg tablet day ago and it ha helped so much already only minor side effect so far headache and a little dizziness
457,xanax,i have been diagnosed with depression and panic disorder for year now i learned over the year that if i could keep my anxietypanic under good control i would be much le likely to go into depression uncontrolled anxiety greatly increase the chance i will experience depression xanax work extremely well at keeping my anxiety and hence depression under control these day i dont need to use it continuously because just knowing that xanax is there and work so well if i need it ha a calming effect i didnt give xanax though because it ha one annoying side effect for me it kill my libido rather effectively if i take it for a few day apart from that very tolerable way more so than any antidepressant i wa on
458,fluoxetine,i have been taking prozac now for plus year originally wa told by md that it would be temporary but my experience ha been after trying to be off it for several month that i need to go back on it i put myself under depression but i had anxiety too after the birth of my first child i developed a real neurosis about sleep i couldnt shut my brain off at night and had insomnia became afraid id never sleep again being on the lowest dose of prozac helped me i would say completely at three week i despaired of ever feeling normal again and by the fourth week saw a real improvement by six week wa very happy and relieved it may be losing it effectiveness somewhat after all these year
459,prozac,i had all of these horrible thought racing through my mind for week before i started prozac i kept thinking about dying my family dying i feared time and death and could not stop the racing thought no matter what i thought i would never get better but then a week after starting prozac i no longer had any racing thought it ha brought me back into the moment no more intrusive thought
460,prozac,i suffer bout of depression and have been prescribed prozac this medication doe stop the weepiness and severe irritability that i suffer however it made me feel quotnothingquot rather than good additionally the side effect that i suffer on prozac are not worth the marginal lack of hopeless feeling i felt nauseous hollow scattered and my libido completely vanished this led to marital stress so i went off of it on my own i think it is the wrong chemical for my type of brain chemistry or depression
462,alprazolam,xanax alprazolam is the only medicine i can take that will stop panic attack quickly some panic attack require mg tab or mg tab my panic can start with or without any trigger anxiety attack are different from panic panic screw up your whole day anxiety attack are more like stress
463,prozac,if you scroll down a bit to you will find my rave review of prozac for ocd and more than people found it useful a well which is great now it a year and a half later and i went from lb i never struggled with weight to lb today and im just quot my diet did not change in fact i battled anorexia in my teen i just dont enjoy food that much and still dont i truly believe some people may eat more but ultimately it mess with your thyroid and hormone bad so this is what ill say prozac is pure genius and doe work very very well you will probably lose weight in the first few month and then a you approach a year the weight come on fast and hard
464,adderall,my doctor gave me adderall because i cant sit still long enough to concentrate and study and do productive thing at work he gave me mg to take twice a day but i didnt feel any effect from the drug i decided to take mg at the same time and still nothing i am so sad right now because all i want to do is concentrate and study and do my job with concentration i wa really excited to take these pill but now am dissapointed i think i am one of those people who are resistant to stimulant medication
465,xanax,xanax worked wonder for my anxiety next thing i know i only ate one meal every four day and lost pound in two week withdrawal is the worst i vomited for seven week straight and at least twice a day ive been clean for two month i still dont sleep until fivesix in the morning i have slight muscle tremor prescription must be monitored extremely carefully
466,fluoxetine,i am starting my rd week on prozac mg daily i feel like a new person and am so grateful i agonized over this choice for week but after month of unbearable anxiety and sadness then skyrocketing blood pressure i knew i had to do something i visited my gp we did the physical blood test etc to rule out other factor it turn out empty nest beginning menopause have done a number on me the medicine made me feel nauseous sleepy like being on cold medicine on the th day my appetite returned i dont notice side effect at all anymore the sadness gone the anxiety gone i also start visit with a therapist in week again im grateful to get my life back
467,alprazolam,i have had strong panic and anxiety attack specially out in public i feared everything always the what if this what if that worried about the worst thing that could happen lived on edge of my seat then doctor gave me xanax and i felt like myself again all fear wa gone and i wa so much happier more at ease with thing i didnt stress out so fast and could go have fun in my life xanax is my life saver
469,fluoxetine,in age i had a nervous breakdown i did a lot of strange thing and ended up in a mental ward because of medication i wa taking i developed a problem with simple walking while at the hospital i decided to reteach myself to walk normally i practiced all the time i got it right by the time i left but i found it wa now impossible to stop walking back and forth i wa pacing all the time this went on at least a year then my doctor thought that prozac would possibly help me after starting prozac week into it i sat down and no longer needed to paceaaaahhhhhpeace at last i continue to take it for depression no side effect noticed
470,prozac,prozac ha changed my life ive suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder anxiety and depression since i wa in my preteen ive tried celexa and paxil but couldnt sleep at all while using them i asked my physician to prescribe prozac on the advice of a friend and ive had amazing result i started at mg a day and increased to mg a day after a month i noticed that i wa drowsy and unmotivated during the day when i took the medicine in the morning so i switched to a bedtime dose and i havent noticed any side effect since then prozac make me calmer and much more in control of my fear others who didnt know i had gone on medication have noticed a positive change a well ive been on prozac for month
471,prozac,ive been on a mg dose for year and it ha helped substantially i had very bad anxiety ptsd and couldnt drive and basically stopped eating my heart would race and i just could not deal with the anxiety anymore taking this dose and having regular therapy ha allowed me to get back to myself i didnt have any side effect and ive never had to increase the dose it is a really great medication
473,fluoxetine,it took about a month to work but i no longer have severe anxiety when i am trying to sleep i dont know how i went so long without it
474,alprazolam,the medicine itself i didnt have an issue with although i still prefer klonopin but it wa the withdrawal i couldnt handle i wa on this medication for two month and since like i previously mentioned i decided to go back on klonopin i stopped taking the xanax xr when i did i felt like a bus ran over me i felt shaky drowsy and like id been out drinking the night before which i havent done in year it really wasnt worth the withdrawal
475,prozac,prozac ha changed my life i had postpartum depression after having a baby amp went for month thinking i could fix everything on my own but nothing alleviated the unrealistic hopelessness my midwife said that one antidepressant doesnt work for everyone it is like putting your hand in a mixed candy jar and pulling one out the effect are that unpredictable prozac ha been amazing for me it ha taken the ocd hopelessness edge off so now i feel like i have a choice about how i feel side effect included feeling nauseous and having diarrhea on the first day my husband say i sometimes tremor at night it doesnt work a well when i am on my period and i often feel really low after having sex overall prozac ha saved my sanity
476,prozac,ive been taking prozac mg for week now it ha changed my life i take other med xanax mg depakote mg norco mg nexium mg for other problem well i take the xanax time a day a needed to help with my anxiety and panic disorder my panic attack were so bad i wa hospitalized for a week i couldnt function i suffered unknown seizure because of panic disorder now i can go about my life the only problem i have with prozac is that it make me go to the bathroom very often the first few day it made me sleepy but that went away im it also help depression too it helped mine a lot i would recommend this to anyone who suffers from severe anxiety like me
477,adderall,doe not work well for me
478,alprazolam,i wa diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma when i wa kidney cancer luckily it wa found by accident and very early stage it wa the best possible diagnosis you can get when you are told you have cancer my grandmother died of cancer my mom died of cancer my dad had skin cancer which wa removed and now my sisterinlaw wa diagnosed with stage iv ovarian cancer and ha been doing chemo and will have surgery tomorrow feb to say i have anxiety is a huge understatement i am in remission it been year there isnt a moment that go by where i dont think about cancer it came to a point where i couldnt get out of bed xanax ha changed my life i can move on and live
479,alprazolam,i normally take xanax to get off to sleep but here lately i have been taking it in the day time a well because i get panicky through the day now a well wish this anxiety would just go away and stay away have an appointment with a psychologist but i really dont think it is psychological
480,prozac,i really like this drug i used to sleep all the time but this give me ton of energy i am one of the few who ha actually lost weight while on it i love my prozac
482,prozac,i started taking prozac yr ago due to a panic attack i then stopped taking it for month felt ok for the first week apart from withdrawal symptom i have now started taking prozac again a my depression ha come back my panic attack are getting worse i feel like cant leave the house and i cry all the time i decided that i should try taking them again
483,mydayis,ive been taking mydayis for about week i wa diagnosed with adhd yr ago and took adderall xr mg mg every day even though it helped me in many way it also made me antisocial anxious over use it sometimes and very thirsty at all time for those reason i decided to try something else mydayis honestly i feel much more motivated my energy increased im not longer antisocial no crash and most importantly i can focus well for about a week i had some side effect increased heart beat couldnt sleep focus well high bp so give it some time to adjust i also read that most people that switched from vyvanse to mydayis are suffering from depression be careful
484,xanax,my psychiatrist prescribes me xanax mg per month i have generalized anxiety disorder and depression and am on other med for that xanax is only for extrastressful situation it is incredibly effective within minute of taking it i am much calmer i notice no side effect whatsoever
486,xanax,i used to honestly be completely against pharmaceutical in every sense until i developed panic disorder i have intrusive thought and experience hypochondria and dissociation literally for hour on end or off and on throughout the entire day it nearly impossible to even live a normal life feeling this way after talking a mg xanax within minute all of those negative feeling start to dissipate it ha truly been a miracle drug for me and ha changed my life for the better
487,alprazolam,i have daily anxiety and wa on ativan for a while and while i loved the ativan i wa looking for something longer acting my psychiatrist tried me on xanax xr mg for me this medicine is a god send in the beginning when i first starting taking it i did notice some slight dizziness and weird feeling but i stuck with it and once it regulated in my system about week i feel totally normal and calm on it with zero side effect i have since upped my dose to the mg xanax xr twice daily if i need it but some day i only take one pill to get me through the day and deal with the anxiety at night since im home and then take a pill in the morning like normal my advice would be to start it on the lowest dose and work your way up
488,prozac,been suffering from depression most of my life ive been on zoloft and lexapro i would change when one seemed to stop working so went to prozac big mistake see the side effect i had almost every one of them doctor couldnt figure out what wa wrong till my wife showed them the side effect almost died lost in about week will never go back to it but who know it might work for you just didnt for me

491,prozac,i started taken prozac mg a day for nearly year i stopped taking them month ago a i thought i didnt need them anymore since ive stopped taking them ive become really agrophobic really depressed cant stop cry ive just shut my self away im thinking off starting prozac again

493,fluoxetine,it took a while for me to get the courage to go to see a psychiatrist i finally decided i had to get my life back i wasnt cooking for my family taking care of my house contacting friend even able to make it through my day at work without hiding in the bathroom to cry fluoxetine ha helped me calm down and get my life back again my doctor started me out slow mg to start i felt funny a few day then when i upped it to mg i once again felt funny for a few day but now i feel i have way more good day than bad it only been week but im so thankful that i started taking it
494,xanax,i wa prescribed this medication in the hospital after suffering severe anxiety attack i wa only given a couple to get me through until i see my doctor but i found out the doctor are unwilling to give you this medication i have anxiety attack everyday but this medication make me stay calm so i dont suffer from these awful anxiety attack i feel relief and that i can go on
495,fluoxetine,one of the few antidepressant i can tolerate most cause major sleep disorder but with prozac i dont have a problem not really sure if it help much with panic attack ive tried mg and mg sometime mg seems to be a bit much
497,xanax,i wa the caregiver for family member from to i had the first fullblown stress panic attack in xanax wa one of my medication and in month i wa off drug i have no regret for those year but thought i wa finally free to live my life however i wa wrong i now have continuous anxiety if i dont take mg xanax in the morning and evening i also have very high blood pressure to which a solution ha not been found xanax doe lower it and i couldnt keep my sanity without it i have had no negative side effect only positive

542,fluoxetine,this is my th review since prozac ha almost completely eliminated my anxiety episode weight loss ceased some time ago and i gained weight back most likely due to drinking appetite is normal bowel movement are more normal than eversorry but when i had severe anxiety that wa a big problem i can speak in large group setting with no problem travel without issue and deal with stressful situation effectively overall i feel great with no side effect con drinking can be an issue definitely drink moderately eat before drinking and drink plenty of water alcohol can sneak up on you and cause drowsiness or blackout believe me i know
544,alprazolam,i use xanax occasionally a required i feel relaxed in real sense feel increase in mental ability sleep well and when i wake up im in a very fresh mood
545,fluoxetine,i am and have been put on fluoxetine for the rd time this year for an anxiety disorder i like this medication but i have experienced some weird side affect in the beginning of each new time prescribed i get really nervous sweaty panic attack and some time feel dizzy all side effect eventually go away but it is very tough to get through the first week i am on the rd week now but the side effect dont seem to be getting better i dont want to give up though because it ha been so helpful in the past for me

599,xanax,i know what it like to lose pound in one month from depression no appetite cant walk without getting tired laying in bed all day cry amp nightmare night after night it so annoying when psychs wont prescribe this because of fear of addiction well guess what if i hadnt have found xanax i would have committed suicide a long time ago you can take this medicine long term if you have severe depression and are responsible
601,adderall,side effect dry mouth anxiety if used when tired euphoria hyperfocus when dose too high adderall allows me to concentrate and study for a reasonable amount of time while also offering flexibility on when i use it both xr and shortrelease are quick inandout drug unlike ssri my performance improved dramatically with use of adderall but there were definitely a few con hyperfocus is a huge problem that alluded me for a few month because adderall affect the brain it distorts the user reality i felt that i wa getting a lot done and it wasnt until my colleague at work told me that i wa garbage at multitasking that i realized my dose wa too high beware of this focus productivity
603,xanax,i suffer from generalized anxiety disorder so xanax ha served a my quotsafety netquot in time of distress when taken a prescribed those of u who need it simply feel like life is bearable again those nagging irrational thought pattern and worry are silenced however xanax is not a medicine to be taken lightly hence the bad reputation it received it short halflife cause craving to redose v klonopin which never give me those feeling use in moderation and make an effort to see a cognitivebehavioral therapist if you havent done so
605,adderall,it helped me control every aspect of my add the only drawback is the short life of the medicine in your system before the half life begin
606,fluoxetine,i wa diagnosed with parasuicide and major depressive disorder i also suffer from obsession rather than compulsion and have anxiety this wa supposed to be a cureall for me until i started having vivid nightmare that i thought only happened because i wa maybe sleeping better turn out prozac made me lose sleep and i would wake up cry with my heart pounding my brother had died so having vivid nightmare related to him dying and other people dying wa absolutely intolerable i would lay in bed and cry because i wa afraid to go to sleep i would force myself to stay up so i didnt have to dream it wa a living nightmare i had no idea that that wa a possible side effect and the medicine wa put on my allergy list

610,prozac,im a year old girl with generalized anxiety disorder which ive struggledam struggling with all throughout high school ive been on prozac for about month now and it helped me get through a lot of very anxietyinducing situation for me before taking this medication it had become very difficult for me to even attend school and often time id have to be absent due to panic attack and overwhelming anxiety the prozac ha made everyday life so much more bearable for me i no longer feel repressed by my anxiety it not a quotcurequot but it ha helped a ton for me and i have much hope for the future now in addition it is also helpful with my mood
611,fluoxetine,it difficult to explain the side effect i experience using fluoxetine i can only describe it a lightening flash in my mind that briefly cause a feeling of confusion a well a momentary loss in my concentration physically speaking i just get an unpleasant sensation thats comparable to the light headed feeling you get when you stand up too fast after getting out of bed but luckily there no pain involved
612,alprazolam,this is the best thing for panic attack ever when i feel one coming on i can take and let it melt under my tongue and it work very fast it ha saved me from going to the er so many time my hat go off to xanax
613,xanax,i have chronic interstitial cystitis not sure on spelling also called painful bladder syndrome it is like a urinary tract infection time i have to go to bathroom any where from every minute up to time every hour so it can be a problem if im away from home if i take my xanax mg i usually dont have to go to bathroom but once every or hr and since it hurt so bad to urinate and plus i can get sleep at night with not having to go every hour it ha been such a relief i rate it a my doctor ha it written or every hour a needed but i try to only take it at night im very cautious
614,alprazolam,i have severe social anxiety and have tried every other medicine out there and nothing ha worked xanax so far ha changed my life im able to talk to people and look them in the eye and not feel stupid every where i went i take mg time a day im just worried about the addiction part ive heard it pretty bad but i rather be happy all the time than having panic attack all the time
615,alprazolam,i noticed my memory wa very much affected on xanax this is the quickest working benzo in my opinion but doe not last long also the withdrawal from xanax were more severe than the withdrawal from the other benzos ive been on it work great for some people but not so much for me
616,xanax,recently wa prescribed klonopin because my doctor didnt like how xanax had such a quick onset but also quick fall i wa okay with the change initially because even at mg xanax would make me so sleepy i couldnt function that made it pretty impossible to take during any day panic ive been have anxiety the last couple day so i took a klonopin last night hoping that i would wake with a sense of calm like i usually did with the xanax nopethe anxiety is actually worse xanax isnt perfect like i said i generally try not to take it unless i am at home so ive suffered a lot when i shouldnt have had to but it ha a much more calming affect than klonopin is giving me i never took it longterm only a needed
617,adderall xr,i started out taking the regular adderall version but it didnt last long and made me have horrible crash period and steroid like rage so far the adderall xr seems to be working better but it doe reduce my appetite substantially ive had to start taking weight gain supplement to ensure that i maintain my proper weight if i miss a dose i feel pretty lethargic and extremely sleepy however the medication ha allowed me to read and focus better than i ever have and i seem more motivated im also able to talk better with others and my social skill have definitely improved
618,adderall,i have benefited a lot with this medication only problem i have is taking it too late in the day and having insomnia side effect like right now it am on a school night and i cant sleep do not take adderall after a certain hour
620,xanax,i have suffered with anxiety and panic attack for year it got so bad i would actually be driving pull over to the side of the road and call because i thought i wa having a heart attack it wa really scary ive been on xanax for year off and on i take mg once a day when i start feeling anxious and my inside feel out of control it doe frighten me to think i could be addicted to this medication but on the other hand if it relief my symptom than i guess i need to take xanax a needed
621,fluoxetine,i started taking this medication because my doctor thought that i had too much stress and anxiety in my life which wa causing me to feel like i couldnt breathe i have never taken any antianxiety depression medicine before and wa very skeptical the first few day to the first few week were not so great i felt tired depressed and just plain crappy i worked through it and kept taking the medication i am now a month into the medication and i feel great i can concentrate on class and other task much better without worrying about other thing my relationship are much better with my husband and child so far so good
623,fluoxetine,this medication is a life saver i think prozac ha saved my life and made my thinking more clear i had been struggling with mental illness for year before i tried prozac i had been diagnosed with adhd and bipolar disorder even though i never had a manic episode i had tried other medication after a suicide attempt i tried zoloft however there wa no effect after this ssri i tried other medication and everything made me unbelievably worse after trying medication like lithium lamictal depakote and abilify i finally wa put on mg prozac and then mg this wa it i felt an instant recovery after week where my mind finally woke up i felt a part of my brain which wa not working wa now working it wa lifesaving
624,adderall xr,i love it because it help me focus and it also help with my anger problem but best of all it help with my appetite
625,adderall,adderall really help me focus and stay on task i used to start project before i took adderall and i always got side tracked and not be able to finish what ive started now that i take adderall i complete task and im able to stay focused throughout the whole project also i complete what ive started thank you adderall you really helped me out

628,fluoxetine,i wa prescribed fluoxetine mg for week of the month and it ha changed my life the first week i had some nasty side effect kept waking at night nightmare nausea generally spaced out and tired but also some more welcome one loss of appetite and really wanted to exercise i barely noticed my period coming that first month for the first time in a long a i could remember i didnt hate everyone or want to cry and i wa able to have normal social encounter without complete paranoia setting in it wa like i had got my old self back month in now i am quite happily still taking them definitely worth trying if you do get really bad pm
629,prozac,i started taking prozac about amp year ago after having a horrible bout of dry mouth with celexa did some research and asked the doctor for prozac i felt much the same a i did on the celexa without the side effect no weight gain but no loss either a one of the other reviewer stated i felt quotneutralquot neither happy or sad it did help with anxiety and stress but after about a year and a half i once again developed severe dry mouth i started taking my mg dose every other day to reduce the side effect but ended up with swelling of my face and tongue i am no longer taking this but would still recommend trying it thought i would do ok without medication but will be making an appointment tomorrow to get something new
630,alprazolam,i dont have panic or depression problem i have sleeping problem i fall asleep fine but wake up around am and can not go back to sleep because my mind is too active thinking about stupid stuff like movie lawn mower hunting visiting my grandkids working on my car music planned project football you name it i take xanax when i wake up earky and cant sleep xanax make me go back to sleep almost immediately and i wake up around am feeling great i have not noted any side effect but i take it only when needed
631,xanax,excellent it help my anxiety tremendously and take care of my panic attack promptly i highly recommend it if you take it a prescribed you will not get addicted i have been taking it for ten year it also help with my high blood pressure and tachycardia
632,xanax,i take this medication a needed i take mg effexor daily which help with the majority of my depression and anxiety but i take xanax when i need to take the edge off i wa recently prescribed this and i have only had to use it twice while flying i go into full panic mode i took an entire pill minute before my flight and it made me relax right away i have never been able to sleep on a plane even during international flight but it calmed me down to the point i fell asleep during both flight it didnt even bother me during take off when the pilot had to slam on the break due to a cargo light this medication doe make me sleepy though i have not taken half a dose so far my panic attack are not a frequent a some
633,adderall,adderall is awesome for adhd that is what i have and when i take my adderall i am able to focus and relax which is just the opposite effect it would have on someone who doesnt have adhd it would act a a stimulator for them and is very addictive
634,adderall,adderall in my opinion is a quotmiraclequot i am prescribed the ir mg strength three time a day adderall i feel ha significantly improved my quality of life
635,prozac,i suffered with obsessive compulsive disorder amp generalized anxiety disorder which caused depression and stress i came on here in june looking for answer i used to be on sertraline but they stopped working after i had stopped and went back on them i thought my life wa over i got put on mg prozac by my doctor and it is the best medicine ever i would highly recommend it it gave me my life back i am so happy no more stress also i have no side effect give it about week trust me and you will see how this work unbelievable

638,fluoxetine,i wanted to share my experience the first week or so of this generic prozac wa a living hell i didnt feel like myself at all physically and mentally this is where a lot of people give up on this medication dont about a month went by and i am so grateful i know that this medication saved my life i am writing a review because i am now broke and couldnt take my medicine today one day off this medicine made me immediately feel like my old depressed and suicidal self again i am addicted to fluoxetine but im okay with that it been month since i started almost a year this may not be the best thing for my body i havent done much research but i dont know what i would do mentally without it
639,prozac,keep my mood within a normal range it allows me to experience sad feeling and happy feeling doe not leave me with a blank face or blank feeling like other antidepressant did
640,alprazolam,i suffer from panic attack that occur after i go to sleep i wake up about an hour or so after i fall asleep i dont have trouble falling asleep freaking out my heart is racing i am terrified and i feel like i will go crazy before it stop they are so scary because no matter how many time i have suffered through them i am always sure i am dying when i have one previously i wa given other medication like buspar or paxil but i didnt tolerate them very well and they did not stop the attack only slowed them down once i wa prescribed xanax i noticed that the medication would actually stop a panic attack in it track which wa a miracle the medication ha almost completely stopped the attack but not
641,fluoxetine,a lanie the poster below me stated prozac also seemed to only make me worse im sure it ha genuinely worked for many people otherwise it wouldnt have such a high average rating but i know for a fact it only contributed to my symptom paranoia impulse unwanted thought rather than relieved them i cut it cold turkey back in college and suffered a few more year without med before finding some relief with celexa but prozac wa definitely not a pleasant experience for me
643,fluoxetine,im i started using prozac because i have ocd and anxiety i am on day with prozac and i feel like ive lost all my emotion and i feel a bit dumb it a wierd feeling i really dont know how this medicine will turn out but all i can say is that right now i feel worse than i probably ever could i cried three time yesterday is this normal to feel dumb and feel so sad and anxious and why doe the medicine do such a thing at first i know that my body is trying to get used to it and all but i am really curious about how this medicine work tecnically what is it trying to do and will it destroy my emotionsand will i have to use it for my whole life or smth
645,prozac,used to read these over and over when i contemplating quotobsessingquot over whether or not to take the medication prozac ha given me my life back life is no longer a struggle just to enjoy it is not a miracle drug you still have to put in the work therapy really help but at time when i feel a wave of anxiety come over me that used to last dayssleepless night i can almost feel the medication working and next thing i know im step down the road from that worry some side effect in beginning with up dosing such a headache and not getting full night sleep but all have passed and i can only say the only side effect is i feel so good i forgot to take my prozac get your life back and just try it
646,fluoxetine,prozac ha been a miracle for my anxiety my anxiety wa always like a constant static in my head this quotstaticquot ha caused me to have social anxiety ha well on prozac i feel my anxiety the static in my head isnt holding me back anymore i talk to people and i can finally be happy and free

649,prozac,i just started prozac again after being off it for several year after going off prozac the first time i tried battling depression with alternative method including yoga exercise and cbt recently i decided i wa losing the battle using these method alone and went back to prozac my experience so far is that the medication is working i have so far not been experiencing the really deep low while on this medication i do feel a bit drowsier that usual although this is not entirely unwelcome a i wa having trouble sleeping before and now i find i am able to sleep and nap more easily exercise and avoiding alcohol dramatically help with the drowsiness issue and also help improve mood further in combination with the prozac
652,xanax,best medication out there for stopping a panic attack in progress by far xanax will probably put you to sleep rating is for it ability to stop an attack
653,xanax,i got prescribed mg of xanax that i take once a day my wife had just died my anxiety wa so bad i would not leave the house nor would i barely eat it made me feel alive again and im able to function and get out and socialize like a normal person again i actually have a appetite now and im getting good sleep again which i havent felt in a long time xanax really saved my life

655,alprazolam,tried this for a few day to help with anxiety instead of my usual klonopin at bedtime do not just switch to another benzo without transitioning had bad nightmare all night and wa a wreak the following day might be good for some people and maybe more for daytime anxiety but definitely didnt help my sleep even when taking a higher dose than i normally do of klonopin on a side note dont rely on benzos longterm gt month you will quickly dig yourself a hole a tolerance inevitably build and your sleep and mental state will be worse than when you started been on benzos for gt year and im slowly reducing mine and it suck pretty bad get on something safer and nontolerance building the sooner the better
656,fluoxetine,i have been on fluoxetine generic for sarafem for exactly year this medication changed my life i wa hesitant to take it or any medication like it because i thought i wa going to feel numb to my feelingsemotions and be a completely different person i have been suffering from depression amp ppmd for a long a i can remember my doctor never picked up on it and i never realized how much it wa affecting my life i wa moody irritable had no patience i would cry for no reason have panic attack for no reason i would wake up in the morning with that emptydreadful feeling everyday wa a struggle some day were much worse than others i feel so much better now i really wish i started taking this sooner

675,prozac,i have been on fluoxetine now for month the first couple of week i wa sick feeling but within month my husband and i could tell a big difference with my anxiety the down fall is the weight gain and after about month i have to take a midday nap i have gain pound in the past month that is the outcome of am nightly hunger and craving i am now trying to fight the nap to sleep all night without waking up it is difficult some day but it is better then having anxiety attack
676,fluoxetine,started this week and can see small improvement hopefully it keep going this way and ill feel good about myself again
677,prozac,a lanie the poster below me stated prozac also seemed to only make me worse im sure it ha genuinely worked for many people otherwise it wouldnt have such a high average rating but i know for a fact it only contributed to my symptom paranoia impulse unwanted thought rather than relieved them i cut it cold turkey back in college and suffered a few more year without med before finding some relief with celexa but prozac wa definitely not a pleasant experience for me
679,xanax,i have taken xanax for about year but only a needed there are many year i never took any amp there are year i took it for a few week to help with my anxiety stress of having a child with a deadly disease amp the depression that ensues i usually take the mg amp cut it in half and only use it time a day occasionally half a day it soothes me amp help my constantly chattering negative mind take a break i have tried ssri amp have symptom of being allergic to them so cant take them ie muscle twitching rash amp itching so xanax is my only recourse i know it an be addictive so am very careful to take it only a needed short course amp usually about half the amount the dr prescribes it ha helped me greatly
681,fluoxetine,it obviously affect everyone differently ive been taking fluoxetine for about year mg per day yes it ha some side effect which are difficult to anticipate and manage it can make me overly excited and at time a little euphoric which arrives quickly making it difficult to contain on the other side i suffered from manic depression and i used to happily go into a black hole in a blind rage and the medication just stopped that completely so i feel like it a very positive trade off i do get very sleepy and tired so honestly i just sleep more i tried reducing my dosage a couple of time over the year ive been taking this but could not handle the withdrawal
682,adderall,ive been on adderall for about year i wa having an extremely hard time focusing extreme fatigue general feeling of being lost and overly emotional and unstable adderall wa an absolute miracle when i started on it my trouble paying attention loss of interest in life constant sleepiness and emotional swing were gone it made me genuinely happy and self confident for the first time in my life
683,xanax,xanax is the best medicine i wa dizzy for two month straight i felt like i wa on a boat and couldnt get off my whole life wa just a mess between working full time school personal life until i found xanax i am on mg twice a day and i have my life back i can tolerate people again this is the wonder drug other than being a little more tired than normal which i will suffer through because it is better than biting people head off every chance i got
685,fluoxetine,i noticed a difference in the first week it wa a positive difference and then about three week later i began to feel how i felt again and i told my parent and i think that i need more than the mg that im on currently but overall i think this drug work very well and you need to find the correct mg for your body
686,prozac,many people say that they gained weight on this medication i actually lost weight i lost pound in a little over a month that ive been on it i have few side effect the only thing i can complain about is that it make me very sleepy but it take away the depression so im grateful
687,prozac,i wasnt sure if this drug wa helping with ocd when asked i would reply quotit seems to make it easier to deal with itquot then my doc decided to lower my dose in order to take me off it when i got to mg i lost it the obsessive thought were out of control compulsion increased a well i am back on mg and feeling and thinking much better the med help a lot but doesnt fix me completely i challenge my compulsion every day so i can reinforce that i do not need them
689,alprazolam,all of the side effect listed for alprazolam are completely ridiculous it sooo long and most of the side effect must be from another medication most side effect from alprazolam are tiredness dont drive until your used to the medication they dont cause weight gain or weight loss dont cause any change in libido i cant even begin to explain why this website mention every part of your body affected including death now there is a few thing you really shouldnt mix with alprazolam like pain pill which is true but simply you take this medication it make you calm right away and it ha a short half life so it out of your system in no time the list of or so side effect just dont happen unless your allergic
690,prozac,i have been on prozac since i had post natal depression in it ha saved my life and my marriage i take mg but my only son left home recently to go overseas and join the army so my doctor increased the dose to mg a i have been feeling anxious and not sleeping a well
691,adderall,once getting on adderall i found it gave me just enough euphoria to put down everything from alcohol to opiate while giving me the drive and ambition to seek an engineering degree i must warn people adderall is a stimulant it out of your body rather quickly day so addiction in the quotphysical withdrawalquot sense is not much although year of taking it will keep you relying on it thats a promise depending on the dosage youll be severely lethargic and wind up sleeping a few day beware of the day end youll likely need something to sleep or relax which can cause problem despite the caution youll be a morning person and love it just remember the word quotmoderationquot and youll be a new you
692,adderall,i stopped taking this medication year ago because i built up a tolerance to it but it seriously wa the best thing to ever happen to me ive always had untreated adhd and when i finally received treatment i flourished now after year i am giving it a try again so far it working great the two thing i dont like about adderall is that i talk way too much share way too much information in fact i call up family member and talk to them to had to write myself a note and tape it to the phone to not call or text anyone and the second thing is the comedown by the time the medication wear off i am drained
694,prozac,i wa very scared of starting prozac because of the review i read i also had tried lexapro and had major panic attack that made me go off of it i have been on prozac for week and am just starting to feel the benefit i feel i can think more clearly and am not living life in constant stress or fear i wish i started in sooner i feel so much better almost like quotwow this is what life for non stress people is likequot side effect i experienced day out of month felt more anxious then normal and have had a little nausea but hardly any it been great
695,fluoxetine,i wa suffering from anxiety and stress primarily but also from depression i have been taking fluoxetine for about week the biggest thing for me ha been some pretty heavy side effect in the first two week the side effect were headache nausea insomnia and le so some agitation i started on a mg daily dose for nearly two week but when i complained about the side effect my doctor cut the side to mg per day i took mg for two week after that and wa then able to go back up to the mg dose the side effect have subsided to a very minor level i have also noticed a decrease in my anxiety and stress level i started noticing an improvement in symptom after week
697,fluoxetine,i took lexapro for a little over a year and it worked beautifully the only reason i weaned off wa because of weight gain my doctor prescribed mg of prozac and said it should not cause any weight gain i am on it day now and my only side effect is slight anxiety and a few panic attack i had none of this on lexapro my question is should i hand in there and when will i feel good
699,alprazolam,a far back a i can remember kindergarten i think ive suffered from major anxiety issue i can remember throwing up in the trash can by the entrance to jr high school and through high school even i could then and can now make my hand sweat just by thinking about it when i finally got on xanax i wa far more outgoing funny and learned there wa a whole side to me i didnt really know existed due to anxiety my point isdont wait talk to some one who can help you with anxiety if you have it and be honest tell them how hard it is for you
700,alprazolam,i like to think of this a headache medicine take only when you have one this medicine should be used in emergency only it is not for taking everyday for that i recommend something that ha a longer shelflifethat take longer to break down like klonopin because of xanax short wait time and short shelflife it can make you feel like an addict if you forget a dose in le than hr you can experience worse symptom of anxiety because they come without warning or provocation instant panic attack inability to think or work etc however a a panic attack reducer or for the instant release of an intense anxietyrelated event i do highly recommend it
701,fluoxetine,i had my nd baby month ago and wa having postpartum depression symptom that turned into extreme anxiety i wa always irritated and very short tempered my year old had to hear me screaming and fighting with my husband and i felt so bad for her i finally made it to the doctor and wa prescribed prozac it is literally saving my life i feel happier and le stressed i dont know if it making me tired since i have an infant and im tired anyway although it been a short time that im taking it i definitely feel the difference
702,alprazolam,unbelieveable i thought i wa living a normal life until my doctor prescribed it for me the first time it ha been a miracle for me
703,fluoxetine,month on this for anxiety and overall ha been very effective significant insomnia obvious decrease in libido back and forth on mg then mg and back to mg i think mg is the best for me though recommend it but it doe take a few week to level out and kickin for sure
704,xanax,after switching my medication three time xanax by far have made the most difference definitely work
705,adderall,i wa diagnosed with adhd in and i found out in order to have adhd a an adult you had to have it a a child so i look back on my childhood in real life did have adhd a kid but never got treatment for it because my mom didnt believe any mental illness so i didnt start treatment with the adhd until i wa placed on ritalin but i found it to be ineffective and then i stopped treatment and i started treatment up again a few month ago and i wa giving our all and i found it to be very effective working but with major side effect keep me awake and constipation but outside of those two it work wonderfully
706,xanax xr,i started seeing a psychiatrist about week ago and since have been on xanax xr mg everyday before that my primary care doc had me on mg and only taking half to one a day at some point i had to start asking for more and explaining that i needed to to take one at least twice a day because i wa having multiple panic attack everyday with every symptom of those you can possible have my life wa miserable until xanax xr came along i take it a noon a it seems i am okay until then and it wear off about pmish i know i have only been taking it a couple week but it been a life saver for me i feel normal againfor myself at least
707,adderall xr,adderall xr lasted no longer for me than adderall ir i wa prescribed mg xr twice daily with it duration being four hour before it stopped working
709,fluoxetine,this is my fourth day on prozac i have been extremely hypermanic in the morning but by night time im exhausted from all the bouncing around that it help me sleep better i talk a lot more and a lot faster i talk to stranger on the street say hi to people which is very unlike me because im normally shy and reserved i felt different the first day i took it i wouldnt say im quothappyquot just not sad ive tried to think about sad thing that used to bother me but i feel neutral now today particularly i started to feel a little down they say with every high come a low so im assuming it crash time with this medication but im hoping it will even out in the next few week which is when youre supposed to feel it full benefit
710,prozac,i took my self to the hospital because my life wa and still is falling apart but after i took prozac i started the feel a bit better but just a someone here mentioned after i took it my mind felt empty for example since before i went to the hospital thought of self hatred self loathing and plenty of suicidal thought took up of my brain each day but since they were gone due to the medicine my brain wa unsure how to react the worst thing in the world could have happened to me and i wouldnt do anything just smile but it felt weird but i did feel a strange sense of optimism while on the drug im never optimistic always pessimistic i stopped month ago i think im going to the hospital soon anyway i feel it
715,adderall xr,had the best result from adderall xr so smooth that i could concentrate and felt like the most normal person with absolutely no high and low i could sit and concentrate for hour go to sleep like normal people and wake up like other adult insurance quit paying for it and had to switch to regular adderall
716,prozac,i am so happy that i finally received a diagnosis and treatment ever since i wa about year old now i have dealt with depression that came in wave my anxiety and obsessive tendency didnt begin until i wa and had the military i always thought that the high stress situation just fed into my depression and caused anxiety and obsession i finally decided to seek help and i wa shocked to find out that i suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder which cause depression and anxiety i started on prozac and within the first week i felt a rush of relief i no longer obsessed over the smallest thing i feel so much happier and my friend and family notice the difference big time
718,alprazolam,i have been suffering from tinnitus for year it wa pretty bearable when i first experienced it however i fell on the ice a few year ago and hit the back of my head and neck i developed vertigo which ha gotten much better but the tinnitus wa still unbearable i tried xanax to calm my anxiety and found it to greatly help my tinnitus i wa afraid of getting addicted to it but i only take a small dose and dont take it everyday when i dont take it the tinnitus is pretty bad i dont know if it is because the anxiety is so bad and it help that but it certainly reduces the volume of the tinnitus
719,adderall xr,i wa diagnosed with adhd when i wa in rd grade and went through just about every medication i have anxiety and some medication really made it worse now and in college and ive been on adderal mg extended release for year and every once in a while i take a quottolerance breakquot taking a break from it really doe help when you go back to u using it take it early in the day or else you will most likely be awake until late hour of the night
720,alprazolam,help me tremendously on an a needed basis to relax i feel great and back in control of my life when i take them they help me to achieve more during the day and to sleep at night when i have a panic attack or anxiety valium is the only comparable medicine for anxiety and stress relief
721,fluoxetine,ive taken a lot of different medication over the year which never really made me feel much better ive been taking fluoxetine mg for month now and have noticed a big change for the better i am so much more relaxed and le stressed at work
723,fluoxetine,i have had depression for many year and i always avoided thinking about taking medication but i just started taking prozac and it already helping im more awake and everything seems brighter it easier to get rid of negative thought and the weight on my chest is gone
724,prozac,when i read the comment about prozac i believe that most of the good one are from people who are still on them or took them for a short period of time the review should include the withdrawal i wa given prozac year ago for anxiety i wa not depressed it worked well for anxiety i tried to come off them many time and suffered what i thought wa a return of anxiety but wa in reality withdrawal since coming off completely year ago i have been destroyed mentally and physically my cognition is very poor i have serious vision problem and dizziness and agitation and im in constant pain my pharmacologist and neurologist are in agreement
725,xanax xr,i am impressed after year on ir xanax and alprazalom mg time a day and all the high and low about a year an a half ago i started to taper off i would break a piece off of each one or sometimes split one in half seriously addicted and missing a dose would be brutali wanted off of these it took a year to get to mg time a day and i felt the same but wa leary of going lower my doctor prescibed me mg xr that i take at am and mg ir to take a needed needle to say i wa shocked that they last so long i used to take my last dose at am and i dont even feel like i need it now i dont want to wake in the middle of the night so i have for the past night i took mg and i think someday ill be off completely
726,alprazolam,wish it would take effect sooner though

728,alprazolam,i have been on many other anxietypanic disorder medicine tried zoloft buspar etc been on xanax mg x daily for about yr but a my situation changed going to multiple panic attack feeling a if appending doom due to attack my doc ha me on the mg xanax time a day with diazepam valium mg x daily and vistaril in between dos to prolong the medicine i have seen my life do a big turn around and i use restoril a sleep aid to get me through the night because i would awake in the night with an attack i understand these are benzodiazepine with the exception of the vistaril it hard to find a doctor willing to accommodate that but it doe work taken properly i have next to no attack thanks to my understanding doctor only thing that work
729,prozac,been on prozac for week now and starting to see light at end of tunnel stomach pain an nausea the first couple week but much better now im sleeping well and feel more relaxed i find i actually want to do thing like take a walk play with grandkids clean house and take care of myself i didnt want to do anything before prozac i just existed thanks to prozac im now living at year old
731,xanax,i have had severe panic attack all my life i dont even know how to explain what this make you fell like it like you cant catch your breath your hand start to go numb my head go numb then i felt like i am going to pas out or am having a stroke i have nothing but a positive experience with this medicine and i have tried others they didnt work i have never had any side effect with xanax so it a but take only a prescibed
732,alprazolam,saved my jobim a truck driver so i spend a lot of time in a truck and it get really depressing being away from the family for week at a time but xanax help me cope with the situation and this is the only medicine ive found that wont make me tired and drowsy unlike zoloft that made me so tired i had to take two day off work xanax help me relax and give me focus so i can deal with my work situation
733,fluoxetine,horrible experience with prozac started taking it on a thursday and by saturday had a buzzing in my ear a full feeling in my head and couldnt sleep on sunday i completely lost my appetite and became very jittery i wa barely able to work on monday and called off tuesday because of generalized anxiety not sleeping or eating i ended up taking three total day off of work due to side effect i literally had to force myself to eat a single slice of toast for breakfast and barely got it down i finally went off of it on wednesday and went back on paxil by friday i am feeling like my old self again plus i had startling dream i wont ever take this drug again
734,fluoxetine,my mom ha been trying to get me on med for my severe angerdue to my pmdd but i am so antimeds finally decided to give it a try mg and it is amazing usually around day before my period i would be a raging maniac but since taking prozac it completly subsided initially i also a someone else stated had trouble having an orgasm so i stopped taking it but when the anger came back i gave it another try and stuck it out and miraculously that side effect went away yayyy
736,fluoxetine,i feel fantastic i feel a massive change in myself im le aggressive anxious depressed and agitated im more patient with thing and people a i suffered with social anxiety im more outgoing and thinking clearer i feel on top of the world and have lost kg a my appetite ha decreased rapidly
737,fluoxetine,awful experience i feel disconnected and struggled with derealization while on this it made me so spacey and my anxiety wa out of control im afraid to go anywhere and hang out with friend it awful this is an awful drug for me i feel like im losing my mind
738,xanax,i wa taking mg per day at equal interval i tried to stop completely and the noise came roaring back so i went back on mg per day and the noise is reduced by or more with minimal side effect so far
740,amphetamine,better than adderall or vyvanse for side effect work the same but not a long
741,fluoxetine,not happy not sad just there actually not even there everything is kind of like a daze but it feel alot better then being crazy stressed out all the time and freaking out over trivial thing just i dont feel like myself but the good thing is im living in the moment instead of the past or worrying about the future
743,fluoxetine,at age obgyn prescribed sarafem for pmdd made a huge difference went through life changing event a death divorce and wa at the bottom and had quit taking the medicine symptom got worse at age changed obygyns had no issue with my st obgyn but just wanted a female dr and she read me the riot act premenopause and last yr confirmed menopause it absolutely make a huge difference in my life i laugh every day dont stop taking it if you have no side effect i dont fly off the handle still get moody occasionally but nothing more than a little venting with a friend cant cure
744,fluoxetine,i wa diagnosed year ago with general anxiety disorder and panic disorder with mild agoraphobia for the first few month i had no idea what wa going on with me except that i knew i would get completely flustered and anxious and scared when i went out to do everyday thing i began worrying all the time about silly thing and couldnt seem to shut my mind off enough to sleep and relax my doctor diagnosed me and for a while i tried seeing just a therapist but eventually my panic attack came back stronger and i decided on medication i have tried three other medication all of which were not successful i am day in on prozac and the side effect have been pretty bad but i have hope today wa much calmer for me
745,fluoxetine,when i read the comment about prozac i believe that most of the good one are from people who are still on them or took them for a short period of time the review should include the withdrawal i wa given prozac year ago for anxiety i wa not depressed it worked well for anxiety i tried to come off them many time and suffered what i thought wa a return of anxiety but wa in reality withdrawal since coming off completely year ago i have been destroyed mentally and physically my cognition is very poor i have serious vision problem and dizziness and agitation and im in constant pain my pharmacologist and neurologist are in agreement
747,amphetamine,i have to say i thought it would be like adderall but it really not i read their study yeah im a dork but i remembering it saying different mixture working different if you are having problem with your current adhd med talk to you doctor and get a pill free trial
750,prozac,this is a great medicine i switched to this after taking lexapro and having some difficulttomanage side effect i did not have any side effect at all on prozac in the beginning i have noticed that recently i have more of an appetite i monitor what i eat so i havent gained weight but it is more of a challenge my sister is also on the same dose but ha not had the hunger side effect
752,fluoxetine,this drug i rate because it wake your brain up from the dead anxiety isnt that simple it slows you from growing mentally and expanding because it becomes apart of your life and you lose focus on everything else i found this to be a miracle drug for anxiety not so much for depression because it can cause suicidal thought to some degree prozac changed my life and career i could not be more satisfied with the result of decreased anxiety
753,fluoxetine,after year of nonmedicinal attempt to deal with my sad i finally decided to give it a shot a it had been really bad the last three year my doctor put me on fluoxetine at mg and then moved it up to mg on the positive side it made me le prone to angry outburst and my low werent a bad ive stopped taking it due to side effect i had some initial insomnia but adjusted however a few day into mg i could only manage hour sleep a night i would be restless and anxious my mind would be racing and wouldnt relax despite the fact that the rest of my body wa exhausted i also had trouble getting and maintaining an erection not being able to be intimate with my wife or sleep well made me depressed so whats the point
754,alprazolam,ok xanax wa the very st benzo i tried my doctor rxd me mg x daily it worked decently but i wa expecting a lot more after talking to doc about it he switched me to klonopin mg x daily all i can say is wow klonopin is so much more effective for me it doe take a couple of hour to kick in but once it doe i cant honestly say how much better klonopin is than xanax both are equivalent mg for mg klonopin ha a much longer half life it just work overall way better than xanax i see so many positive review of xanax but im wondering if most of them have tried a different benzo
755,alprazolam,with the panic attack i get it seems xanax work fairly fast when i feel one coming on or even when i am in the middle of one it calm me down and i can cope i have taken it for several year and have felt no side effect i am glad it is available to me
757,xanax,i started out valium for about year mg x a day used for anxiety and sleep it worked wa a comfort to know most of the time used per day so i always had extra i think knowing i had extra help almost a much then dr changed prescription to alprazolam mg tablet time a day some heavy difference at first it worked well in the beginning i felt it minute after i took it and only needed per day now im at per day thats mg and i dont feel it i dont know about withdrawal but i hear it pretty hard to get off and ive been on them for year not sure what to expect but think i would feel more alert and energetic too
758,fluoxetine,ive been taking fluoxetine for at least month now for severe depression i couldnt sleep or eat even getting out of bed to open the curtain wa difficult for me my gp put me on mg a day and did i notice a change in myself not only happy but motivated and hold a job down a year later im on mg now and still have my bad day boy do i notice it if i miss a day it wa the best thing i could have done and i swear by it
759,prozac,i started this medication because i have struggled with depression anxiety and panic attack i have been put on random depression med since i wa year old and am now ive tried lexapro welbutrin and a bunch of other stuff i never really saw improvement a a teenager on these drug but it could have been my hormone at the time i tried prosac at year old and it seemed to make a real difference for me i think i started to feel the difference within the first week but that might have been a placebo affect after at least week is when i think it really started to work and i could feel a difference my anxiety level started to drop pretty drastically and i wa no longer afraid of thing like the dark
760,fluoxetine,i take mg daily and my binging and purging ha subsided by please note it took me a long time to work up to this high dose my quality of life ha improved immensely and for the first time in year i am not thinking about food and weight constantly one side effect i do experience is tiredness which i find frustrating but whenever i try to reduce my medication intake i start binging and purging again out of the antidepressant i have tried over the year this ha been the only one to assist without dreadful side effect topiamate i wish everyone luck with their personal battle and know how challenging and isolating this condition can be take care
761,fluoxetine,been on this med for a year havent ended up in the hospital since for panic disorder and depression it make my mood stable and give me energy and motivation to live life im in my mid s and am lucky how much this drug ha helped me my anxiety and panic disorder can be frightening plus the depression aspect can make for a scared and cry disaster the negative ive had on this wa when i first started i could not eat but that side effect did go away after a few week the other side effect is not being able to fall asleep without some sort of drug to slow my brain down ive been on a combination of mood drug i plan to stay on prozac
763,prozac,i have suffered from severe depressionanxiety for year now i also suffer from ptsd i have tried almost everything out there and prozac is the only antidepressant that i can take and that work for me i am very sensitive to medication and im glad i have found at least one medication that help my severe depression it help motivate me and keep me alive i have been on mg for a long time and then recently went to mg i think i need to increase my dosage even more so but it ha been the only reliable medication i have ever taken and for the longest duration
764,xanax,ive taken xanax prescribed by my dr for almost yr and i think it great for nerve anxiety and good sleep i take it at night and sleep sound all night and in the morning get up refreshed im an insomniac so the help sleeping is amazing i give it a just stick with the dose the dr prescribes
765,alprazolam,to me xanax wa a lifesaver in august i suddenly collapsed and wa in hospital for week and then had about month of test which i wa finally diagnosed with vestibular lesion which is ringing in ear and balance disorder due to a problem with nerve i wa only getting hour a night sleep on valium due to this and my body would just jerk most the time ii wa about to go to wa starting to think life not worth living i came across xanax with my friend giving me mg early and i had my best sleep in month i spoke to my doctor and he agreed in my situation that xanax would be helpful a it doe calm the nerve so month later still taking but now been on mg for past month and now have some life
766,alprazolam,ive been taking this medication for a long time yr i wasnt warned about the memory problem or any way of becoming addicted i can happily say it ha helped me i even went into agoraphobia stage also from my own personal experience be very careful in taking this medication i actually saw for myself how bad the memory problem can be when i experienced that i went to my dr an said i wanted ween myself off but slowly not stupid either ive have been addicted to this medication but u have to realize our brain our mind is powerful than we give it credit for i wa using mg time a day im now down to amp a half time per day im getting better again
769,alprazolam,only benzodiazepine that worked completely been on all the others have tried antidepressant with negative result so at the correct dose alprazolam is what i consider the hardest working anxiety and stress reliever available
770,fluoxetine,i have limited history with psych med amp i haven only tried two other antidepressant zoloft and remeron both were awful for me side effect outweighed any minimal benefit they may have had but since taking prozac nearly two week ago my mood ha changed entirely i take it in the morning and it give me a sense of purpose and excitement to experience the day before i wa having panic attack so bad before work i would consider calling in prozac ha not had any negative ssri side effect like i had with sertraline but i am going to continue paying attention to how i feel over time on this my anxiety is minimal and melatonin currently ha me sleeping like a baby i hope it never stop working for me for now this medicine is great
771,alprazolam,i wa prescribed this med because i lost my dad very suddenly recently and suffered my first full blown panic anxiety attack the attack itself wa the usual numbness and tingling sensation hard time breathing and impending doom thought i wa told to take on a a needed basis so thats what i did i started to have the strangest thing happening to my body flu like symptom with hot and cold flash and pain all over my usually high blood pressure kept falling and i wa dizzy and lightheaded my doctor attribute it to anxiety and directed me to take more so we upped my dose and omg the pain wa worse now i know i might just be sensitive to this drug but my friend had the exact same experience with it so beware
772,prozac,i am a recovering opiate addict and alcoholic i have been sober for five year and extremely grateful however i have been diagnosed several time by physician a having depression it got so bad about a month ago that i decided to try prozac mg i have been on celexa in the past but it made feel disconnected the prozac took about three week to kick in but it is working wonderfully now for a few day it is like a switch wa flipped and i just feel normal and positive i do have some of the usual side effect but they are bearable everyone is different for sure but i am very pleased with prozac thus far if you are trying this medicine stick with it a it doe take a while to have an effect very grateful
773,adderall,well i have been on adderall for about month mg daily i wish i would have taken it sooner though i am a single mom of twin year old and i noticed that i needed this birth control i couldnt even get out of bed focus complete and daily normal function daydream etc i finally realized it wa needed after my mother had her heart attack and i could not focus not even at work i went to my doctor and he put me on this and i feel great of the time weight loss great i recommend this to anyone that need something to really save them from spiraling down and not being able to be quotnormalquot great

778,prozac,it made me crazy i couldnt eat or sleep or sit still
779,adderall,please be aware of all side effect before taking this drug adderal is highly addictive and it is very likely that taking this drug will continue to do so for a long period of time out of necessity it best to slowly decrease the intake of the drug so the withdrawal symptom are not intense taking more than prescribed can lead severe amp even life threatening situation hallucination hearing voice severe insomnia amp personality change are inevitable if abused with that being said this is a highly effective yet short term solution bc of the dependency factor at time the side effect may be so severe that the person taking the drug doesnt even notice bc they are so happy and focused on everything excessive movement
780,alprazolam,i have taken xanax for year and it ha been a lifesaver for me when my psychiatrist prescribed it for me year ago i wa just about at the end of my rope i wa cry all the time wa hyperventilating had bout of my heart fluttering and many other typical quotanxietyrelatedquot symptom i wa at the point that i wa afraid i wa dying or going crazy over the year my dosage ha been adjusted to work with my life at the time but i have always taken it exactly a prescribed and have never wanted or needed more than wa prescribed a a matter of fact i am currently taking mg two time per day but can take a much a mg five time per day
781,fluoxetine,after being diagnosed with anxiety and depression prozac is the first antidepressant i wa prescribed it took a while to kick in my body and then i had to even up the dose after a month or so after faithfully taking it everyday i noticed i started to stutter a lot ive never in my life had a speech problem it got so bad that i had to stop taking it although it did make me feel better every day hoping to try something else
782,alprazolam,it kick in fast when you get that real bad feeling but im tired of taking pill everyday and it happenes everyday a few time a day bad body ache breathing chest pain i dont even worry about anything and boom it creep up on me fast
783,fluoxetine,i wa suffering from generalized anxiety disorder with some panic it wa a miserable situation and although i gutted it out for many year i finally decided to try med my doctor prescribed prozac mg initially im not going to lie those first couple of week were rough it actually made me more anxious and pretty jittery sleep wa not restful but then just about the time i wa going to give up week into it and try something else i started feeling better eventually i felt a lot better i now take mgdaily and i feel like i got my life back i dont think i realized how small my life had become until the anxiety abated for someone who can gut out the initial few week it is so worth it

787,fluoxetine,hello all i decided to post my experience with prozac to support others a well i wa suffering from extreme anxiety and panic attack prior to this i had no prior history from my mental disorder so this wa all new to me it wa also interfering with my life work social life i decided to see a psychiatrist she recommended prozac the first week it wa really tough i had really bad nausea i had constant headache i felt like my brain wa being rewired i felt out of it i couldnt sleep well once i hit the th week and beyond everything started getting better i have been on for month on prozac and i feel like my old self i feel normal again and all the symptom are gone and the anxiety and panic attack are gone
788,xanax,calm my anxiety better then anything else when i have anxiety attack and take one or two xanax i actually feel normal again and a lot more outgoing and im not so shy or afraid to meet and talk to new people that i may meet
791,xanax,started at took it until it the only medication that ever worked for me i wa a guinea pig for month day after taking it it wa a miracle medicine i actually called my dr thanking him i had finally gotten the elephant off my chest never abused it sometimes dealing with anxiety so a not to get addicted are there any drs left that will prescribe real working medication for people who really need but do not abuse it i do not need a psychiatrist i just need a one put it one in hand just in case doctor today think it taboo to even mention this medication im not nor do i abuse it i take a mg at night and sleep like a rock hey drs this medicine work
792,fluoxetine,i have lived with premenstrual dysphoric disorder for almost decade i wa prescribed this wonderful pill to help me and i adore it my flow is now moderate to light for the first time since i started my cycle i no longer have nausea inducing back cramp and my cycle ha shortened from day to day even better my irritability ha decreased and the hulk no longer scream and run from me in terror when i have my period it is a relief to be free of uncontrollable irritability awful cramp heavy flow and depression
794,fluoxetine,i just started prozac again after being off it for several year after going off prozac the first time i tried battling depression with alternative method including yoga exercise and cbt recently i decided i wa losing the battle using these method alone and went back to prozac my experience so far is that the medication is working i have so far not been experiencing the really deep low while on this medication i do feel a bit drowsier that usual although this is not entirely unwelcome a i wa having trouble sleeping before and now i find i am able to sleep and nap more easily exercise and avoiding alcohol dramatically help with the drowsiness issue and also help improve mood further in combination with the prozac
795,fluoxetine,given my experience on this medication i should probably give it a quotquot but im going to give it a because of my initial response to it ive had depression for year and the symptom have never remitted which eventually lead to my choice to seek hospitalization last year however a week after i went on this medication my symptom were completely gone all of the cognitive impulse control and executive functioning deficit related to my partially remitted depression disappeared howeverthe medication made me manic in about a month i started experiencing paranoid delusion and had to admit myself to the hospital again im heartbroken that it didnt work for me but maybe it will work for others
796,prozac,wa able to lift me out of a severe postpartum depression
797,xanax,this drug help with anxiety so much im taking mg only when i need it it work great
802,fluoxetine,ive been taking prozac mg for week now it ha changed my life i take other med xanax mg depakote mg norco mg nexium mg for other problem well i take the xanax time a day a needed to help with my anxiety and panic disorder my panic attack were so bad i wa hospitalized for a week i couldnt function i suffered unknown seizure because of panic disorder now i can go about my life the only problem i have with prozac is that it make me go to the bathroom very often the first few day it made me sleepy but that went away im it also help depression too it helped mine a lot i would recommend this to anyone who suffers from severe anxiety like me
803,fluoxetine,ive been on prozac for just about month at first i did not notice a difference for about a month then i started feeling more energized for a few week however the weight is going on a fast a grass grows im seeing my doctor today and need to switch ive even been working out walking and have been more active the weight gain is awful at least for me
805,xanax,i dont know how to explain the turmoil and suffering that i went through in the mid ninety even after a perfect childhood at year old i found myself pound in the hospital because i could not eat i could not sleep and i could not function however misdiagnosed a an eating disorder and depression it took me quite a few time to even go to a doctor that noticed i may be a bit nervous i bet that wa an understatement because i keep getting slack about the medication i have tried kalanapin which brought me out like a teenager and did not work for me i have tried valium which wa way too strong for me i have been on this medication for over year and have never had to up my dosage not once and it still work
807,fluoxetine,today is only my first day and i have to say i got really angry with something that happened at work and normally i can shrug this off but it like i couldnt control it and wa super quite that morning then through the day i felt better ive had headache and bad diarrhea the headache happened before the medicine so im not sure it related and very slight nausea ill blog again once a little more time ha passed
809,amphetamine,i am so thrown off at how many positive review i have seen on this stuff however i must have an insane ph balance cause amphetamine to become ineffective but i do not see how it is possible to take the highest dose they provide and not even feel nothing like i have not taken anything at all the other night i got so tired that i fell asleep without warning
810,prozac,i started on mg of prozac for month after mo i noticed getting agitated and very angry at my past childhood trauma ruminating again and wanting to change my family name it got so bad that i went up in dose and now i feel it doesnt matter a much i am positive sleep like a baby have energy and enthusiasm
811,fluoxetine,prozac worked wonder for my anxiety and mild depression i always struggled with pmsrelated anxiety but after some big life change morning anxiety wa more and more frequent and my motivation and drive to accomplish anything wa low i didnt want to get out of bed even though nothing wa wrong with my life i just had an overarching feeling of hopelessness went to the doctor and she prescribed mg had bad nausea the first two week then it went away but i wa still struggling with anxiety some morning she bumped me up to mg and although it only been a few day i can totally tell a difference im more motivated happy and content no anxiety no nausea grateful for this med i feel good for the first time in awhile
812,prozac,after trying several ssri and suffering horrible side effect i wa scared to try another after doing a bit of research i came across liquid prozac and asked my dr about it i have been on it for a week at mg and already feel better i am slowly moving up to mg but a of now mg is working out just fine my anxiety ha lessened and i can focus and concentrate without my mind running wild
814,alprazolam,yeah it work some people are more sensitive than others generally you take a pill depends on dosage and you just start feeling your tight chest and stomach release and i notice i begin breathing more calmly and normally just feel good all over which is such a contrast from the horror of anxiety it can make you a little sleepy i think for normal people it would make them very sleepy for anxious people i think it make you normal and relaxed the one problem is that if you take it too much like three day in a row the effect is reduced and you have to up the dosage i think it work best for occasional use like before a difficult situation or when youre just having a lot of anxiety and need calm
815,alprazolam,it help me from having severe anxiety attack i do go through normal emotion so i only take them when i get too overwhelmed and i am going to have an anxiety attack they are very helpful
816,alprazolam,i have suffered from anxiety and panic disorder for all of my adult life when i wa diagnosed with leukemia my level of anxiety wa at at all time high because it also caused severe bone pain my painmanagement doctor had some sample of niravam the first week i tried it my life wa changed in a huge way it go to work so quickly if most effective and the halflife of this medicine seems short so you arent being quotovermedicatedquot ive suggested it to others with the same disorder but sadly most doctor have never heard of it i appreciate a safe effective medication and just wish that more doctor were aware that it more effective and no or very few sideeffects so they can benefit more patient
817,adderall,in school i could not focus and went through bad moment that i will never forget writing this i can still picture all of those who made disgusting gesture because i would leave group project way through high school i wa in the verge of failing although my commitment and dedication to reach the dream of going to college kept me strong
819,alprazolam,ive been taking this medicine for day and all i can say is wow is this what normal life is supposed to feel like i wa diagnosed with a chronic pain condition that is caused by a lifetime full of anxiety and the tightening and clenching of muscle that were not intended to be in constant use the pit in my stomach is gone and i am actually looking forward to waking up in the morning and being able to face the day anxiety free

822,fluoxetine,i have clinical depression and prozac is how i initially got introduced to the world of pharmaceutical i took two type of fluoxetine one from the hospital green and the other from target white while the one given to me at the hospital worked good the one from target did not work at all the side effect for me were no ability to feel any emotion zombie like tired no appetite i lived off of one slice of pizza a day along with some cranberry juice and it had to be forced down decreased libido giddiness constant mind fog a feeling of euphoria followed by fatigue dry mouth it worked better than cymbalta but since fluoxetine is generic my doctor doesnt approve of it
823,prozac,about month of using this medicine i started to notice the way it effected my thinking thing would come up in my life that wouldve normally triggered my depression however when these thing happened i felt a fake sense of relief i felt like i wanted to be upset about these thing that were happening but my brain wouldnt let me it felt unfamiliar and unlike myself it wa a though i could feel a whole layer of feeling that i wa unable to express my doctor switched me over to zoloft and im noticing better result
824,alprazolam,i have anxiety for a long time taking zoloft for it since not sure how much it help but when i get really bad i take xanax mg it doe help quickly my only thing on xanax i wished that it wouldnt be habit forming and because of that you may need to make dosage higher and higher after mg also recommend checking for interaction with xanax if you are taking any other medicine

847,prozac,after being diagnosed with anxiety and depression prozac is the first antidepressant i wa prescribed it took a while to kick in my body and then i had to even up the dose after a month or so after faithfully taking it everyday i noticed i started to stutter a lot ive never in my life had a speech problem it got so bad that i had to stop taking it although it did make me feel better every day hoping to try something else
849,prozac,i have been taking prozac for two month the first month i did not notice a difference but after week i wa not obsessing or getting angry and noticed i wa more relaxed around other people being a shy person from the day i wa born i am still not interested in anymore social interaction however i have noticed that i am now extremely tired on the prozac which is debilitating and frustrating since i have an exam to write in day and have no motivation to study i have lot of energy when i am exercising so i dont think it due to low iron or nutritional deficiency went to doctor today and he recommended i stay on it for another month so the medicine normalizes in my body
852,prozac,i took this with bupropion i stopped bupropion because i wa so edgy and irritable it wa suggested i wait for prozac to take full effect in about month i stopped prozac last night after a week of it alone i wa edgy irritable and didnt feel like doing productive thing like care about my job or care about studying on investing choice i just wanted to take a nap to relieve the buzzing in my head today i am not taking anything i feel better than yesterday

855,fluoxetine,prozac worked well for me with no serious complication or bad side affect a plus for mewas very good memory i used this medication for over year and wish i wa still able to use it the only problem i did have with prozac wa at the end of year i started getting terrible horrible headache so bad that i would cry i no longer can take any ssri and or any benzodiazepine i think maybe after so many year your body isnt able to tolerate it i began having severe breathing problem im now on the trial amp error time again which most of u know that it isnt fun good luck to everyone

879,fluoxetine,i have spent a lot of time reading thread on prozac they have all been very helpful during these past few month so i thought i should share my own experience just in case anyone out there might find it helpful i started prozac mg about month ago i always knew i had anxiety and mild depression and wa always curious about taking antidepressant but when my boyfriend and i broke up i literally went to my psycdoc the very next day i had done my research on adrsquos and thought that prozac would be the best for me my doc agreed i kept a log every single day i took prozac starting from day until day it took day before i started feeling little random burst of happiness but up until day it wa pure torture it hurt to smile i completely lost my appetite i could not sleep i wa sad i experienced soooo much anxiety is wa painful but thanks to reading all these thread i did not give up and wa hopeful that thing will get better just a everyone said it will every day after day just seemed to have gotten better and better and on day it finally hit me and i understood what prozac is all about yes it is true that it is a life saver if i had to put it in just two word to explain how i feel on prozac i would have to say ldquocalmrdquo and ldquoclearrdquo but irsquom not finished just yethellip after a few week i started feeling like the mg wasnrsquot really working so my doc increased my dose to mg this time around i almost gave up and went back to mg but thankfully i did not for week of taking mg i wa soooo tired fatigue and lethargic i did not experience this on mg and i wa constantly hungry too so after week i called my doc so i can make an appointment to go back down to mg he wa out of town so i had to wait when his office called me back to schedule me in the awful side effect of mg were gone and i wa back to feeling clear calm and happy again so here is my own personal advice from my own journey with prozachellip irsquove been on it for a little over month you have to get worse before you get better no matter what you think you will get better prozac is literally reprogramming and rewiring your brain and that take time side note irsquom year old and exboyfriend and i are back together and happy so were all those day of torture worth it it sure wa
880,fluoxetine,prozac made me feel a lot le depressed a first but then it started causing really bad insomnia
881,alprazolam,i have had severe panic attack for year finally got a doc that prescribed this and wow it is an amazing medicine my doctor retired and it seems every doctor now is afraid to prescribe it due to the one who abuse it i dont take it daily but my mind stop racing and i can sleep when i use it i gave it a because of slight drowsiness some morning
882,xanax,it made me tired and didnt relieve my anxiety
884,alprazolam,since i have developed an intense fear of flying i stopped flying for yr altogether in i had a strong desire to start traveling again so i asked my doctor if there wa something he could prescribe me so i could sleep and not feel anxious on flight and he prescribed xanax my fear is so intense is that i have to take mg of xanaz on a three hour flight in order not to be anxious but it work perfectly im able to be on the plane and i sleep for a good portion of the flight with no anxiety i do have some memory last i often do not remember leaving the airport or much what i do for a few hour afterward but i am able to sleep it off
885,prozac,for me prozac wa unfortunately not so much of a success i didnt feel worse but i didnt feel great either i started taking it in oct with a dose of mg then upped to mg and eventually to mg so really i changed dos time in month which is probably not the best since you dont get to get use to the drug but anyways i wasnt feeling any better still felt down and very depressed my psychiatrist ha officially switched me to venlafaxine which im afraid of since the review of that drug arent all positive i have to say while on the prozac sometimes i felt good but the majority of the time i felt very depressed not because of the drug my side effect were fatigue and diarrhea
886,fluoxetine,for year i struggled with depression unknowingly since i could remember never thought to take any action though until a few tragic event happened then came the suicidal thought and such so i went to a doctor and got this prescribed to me prozac mg i can honestly say i have never felt so good in my life havent had any suicidal thought or anxiety or very much depression the only thing i can say negatively about this medicine is that it did decrease my sex drive and left me feeling quite tired and with a lack of energy when i first started taking it lasted about day ever since then no such problem have occurred except for the lack of sex drive thank you prozac you honestly saved my life
887,prozac,i have taken prozac and mg quite a few year ago with really positive outcome but at a point it stopped working so i went to welbutrin recently i started to get panic again and my doctor thought adding prozac into my daily regimen would help because it worked so well in the past the side effect were so difficult for week cry unable to eat anxiety every minute lost about pound which wa a good side effect but they did subside it seemed to be working but now some day i am having anxiety again and tremor daily unfortunately it isnt working this time around and will be switching off it but i would definitely recommend it for people since it did once work wonderfully for my panic and gad
889,fluoxetine,didnt work at all found it only made me feel worse
891,adderall,i knew i struggled with add in college but refused to go on medication because of the stigma associated with adderall my father ha add a well and refused medication now at he is homeless cant hold down a job cant control his finance health or any responsibility when i graduated college and started my fulltime job i realized that i wa heading towards the same path a my pop i love my job and am very passionate about it but following instruction or staying on task during an hour work day wa impossible mg of xrday x on my v busy day saved my job and life i feel like i finally have a clutch to support me with my disability now it ha improved every aspect of my life social financial academic etc

916,adderall xr,i wa diagnosed with adhd a a kid because i wa our typical class clown that didnt do anything in class my parent took me to the doctor and i wa prescribed adderall and it did what is wa suppose to but i absolutely hated because instead of playing at recess i would just read a book so i quit taking it fast forward to freshman year in college i wa completely overwhelmed with school so i went back got tested and they put me on vyvanse it did the job but i wa so mad when i wa on it they switched be to adderall it doe exactly what it is supposed to do make you productive i went from a to a from this medicine but make sure you eat if you are on it your body will not tell you youre hungry
917,alprazolam,recently wa prescribed klonopin because my doctor didnt like how xanax had such a quick onset but also quick fall i wa okay with the change initially because even at mg xanax would make me so sleepy i couldnt function that made it pretty impossible to take during any day panic ive been have anxiety the last couple day so i took a klonopin last night hoping that i would wake with a sense of calm like i usually did with the xanax nopethe anxiety is actually worse xanax isnt perfect like i said i generally try not to take it unless i am at home so ive suffered a lot when i shouldnt have had to but it ha a much more calming affect than klonopin is giving me i never took it longterm only a needed
918,alprazolam,i take mg it make me calm but also depressed and sad with no energy mary
919,adderall xr,mine may be a somewhat rarer case of adhd that is very severe and my response to amphetamine is almost perfectly paradoxical for the best known effect i sleep better and longer with significant blood concentration it neutral for going to sleep but keep me asleep longer have better appetite can not achieve euphoria or a quothighquot from amphetamine only a mild feeling of extra energy for me adderall is far le effective than single ingredient disomer formulation best guess is that the lisomer is what ruin it for my condition or perhaps the more exotic salt vyvanse desoxyn dexedrine are much more effective and without sideeffects for me didnt expect the difference but adderall doesnt work well with my brain chem
920,adderall,before adderall i wa on edge i had put everything off and neglected myself and my relationship now i have that drive to want to do what i love eapecially art im a graphic atrist and have that drive again anyone that is irritable with every little thing feel lazy cause u dont want to leave your house and have no social life please see a doctor to test u for adhd add it will i promise change and possibly save ur social life and self esteem

922,adderall,im a mid s female who should have been on add medicine year ago this is the only one ive tried so nothing to compare it to love adderall because of the obvious side effect take it in the morning and can get out of bed in minute without feeling the normal exhaustion ive felt my whole life first few hour of day no appetite so in beginning weight loss and now weight maintenance and energy throughout the day until it wear off almost like an extreme diet pill even though i have energy to run around and could get stuff done seem to just run around aimlessly not doing anything with a point i snap and have a temper that i never used to have

926,prozac,ive been taking this pill since grade so ive been on the medication for yr now and i havent experienced any bad side effect but in my opinion it didnt fully help me recover even over a year ive taken it i would still get thought of suicide or hurting myself either if it physically or emotionally but since last summer when ive told my youth worker about whats been going over in my life and she suggested i go to my psychologist and see if hell up my dose or use a different medication or using therapy ive went from to mg and ive been doing a lot better in my college test and exam
927,prozac,prozac really saved my life year ago when i wa suffering from major obsessive compulsive disorder and insomnia related to it tried to stop it few time but always had to come back no sexual side effect even at mgday unofortunately it seemed that the medicine had poopedout on me after year and i currently started taking paxil

945,adderall xr,on my th day of adderall xr i just bumped up to mg today and let me tell you best adhd drug i have ever taken one i feel happy and content two i am a ton more focused and three i can sit on my couch and just chill or go out and play basketball with my friend or basically do whatever my motivation is amazing i tried focalin xr concerta strattera worked for a year then just stopped working but i asked my doctor to let me try this medicine and that is the best choice i have ever made no insomnia but be ready for a loss of appetite i lost lb in the day ive been taking this a long a it keep working a it is i can see me being on this for a long time

950,prozac,prozac worked for about a week or two i felt very happy and pleased i could handle my problem and my suicidal thought went away but now every and anytime im sad i have suicidal thought and they are worse than ever before
951,adderall,for me adderall is a dream and a nightmare all wrapped in one pill when i wake up i need the adderall just to be productive in my day it work like a charm and make me more creative and motivated but i find that i need more and more to keep going eventually when the day is over and it too late to take any more pill i feel zoned out and unable to sleep if adderral came with a powerful sleep medicine it would be a perfect drug although i dont like the antisocial aspect that come with it you get so concentrated that you become socially awkward and dont want to talk with anybody also when i drink on adderall i can become crazy aggressive at time but other than that i love adderall ive done some of my best work on it
952,fluoxetine,im hoping my post will help others who are on the fence about antidepressant my story in short is anxiety ha plagued me since my teen depression joined the parade in my late teensearly s i have tried several medication over the year and because they either made me flat or sick i didnt stick with them recently decided prozac would be my last attempt i started taking mg every morning week ago i have had very little in the way of side effect some mind shakiness in the morning little bit of difficulty falling asleep mild fatigue and dampened appetite the benefit to this point are surprising i am much calmer the anxiety is gone the depression is still present but not like week ago and before it dissipating for sure life doesnt look so quotall or nothingquot which is a nice change my spouse said my quotfidgetsquot are gone i wa almost constantly moving in some form or another i know some people think the medication reaction is quotall in one headquot but since my problem are all in my head i dont care if it the medication me thinking it is or a combination all i can say is for the first time in a very very long time i am able to run errand be more social and have actually gotten a full time job in the past week i am able to better care for myself now thus able to care better for my spouse i have no plan to stop the prozac with mgonce a day being a low dose and with it helping to this point im going to roll with this a long a i can
953,xanax,yeah it work some people are more sensitive than others generally you take a pill depends on dosage and you just start feeling your tight chest and stomach release and i notice i begin breathing more calmly and normally just feel good all over which is such a contrast from the horror of anxiety it can make you a little sleepy i think for normal people it would make them very sleepy for anxious people i think it make you normal and relaxed the one problem is that if you take it too much like three day in a row the effect is reduced and you have to up the dosage i think it work best for occasional use like before a difficult situation or when youre just having a lot of anxiety and need calm
954,fluoxetine,i am going through menopause i have been cry most day for about a year i have constant obsessive negative thought about myself i went to the doctor to request hrt she talked me into prozac i wa diagnosed with low depression mid range anxiety and high stress i have only been taking this for day but already my life ha changed the tear have stopped i am no longer obsessing about thing that might or might not happen my confidence is back i am reaching out more socially and feel once again that life is good i do however eat well and exercise regularly i dont think any thing can counteract a poor diet and no exercise hot flash have also almost disappeared so far no side effect
955,amphetamine,i just started this medication and i like it for the hyperactivity side of my adhd i have tried almost every adhd medication but most recently wa on vyvanse with the vyvanse i had great concentration but the hyperactivity wa not controlled well so she had me try adzenys ive only been on it about a week and the taste is not that bad for being a dissolvable medication but i will say that i cant take it immediately and then go to work because i become almost spaced out i know i probably need to adjust to it and it great once the first hour ha passed im still unsure whether i will stay on adzenys or switch back to vyvanse but so far so good
956,xanax,please try a different benzo before this drug it a life ruiner the effect are so strong and leave the body quickly it make you crave more tolerance build like crazy with this drug too i suggest klonopin it work great and last a lot longer withdrawal is horrible from xanax you can die from it also come with severe memory loss while taking it
957,fluoxetine,my dr told me to take this to ease premenstrual syndrome one week before my period the second time i used it i felt very strange i couldnt stop cry i called my dr and broke down in her office before this i had not spoken more then a few sentence to her she got upset with me and told me to see a shrink who put me on prozac week of use and i had a manic episode and wa informed i had become chemically bi polar and that ssri can cause this to happen it took year to feel ok again

962,prozac,took prozac for about four year it worked in relieving my depression anger and anxiety but left me numb a well had almost no quotlowsquot but no quothighsquot either i had no side effect other than i now realize a reduced sex drive
963,prozac,i have been suffering from depression and anxiety for over a year i finally decided to look for help because i wa feeling really numb and hating my life just feeling like a failure i am on my th week and i am still waiting for my mood to improve i read some people say it might take week to start kicking in and i can not wait to feel better and have positive thought again any word of encouragement would be greatly appreciated
965,fluoxetine,i had all of these horrible thought racing through my mind for week before i started prozac i kept thinking about dying my family dying i feared time and death and could not stop the racing thought no matter what i thought i would never get better but then a week after starting prozac i no longer had any racing thought it ha brought me back into the moment no more intrusive thought
966,fluoxetine,i have been put on fluoxetine twice on the second time of taking it i suffered with all the stated side effect a my body got used to it infact i got worse for about two week i would urge anyone feeling like this in the first week of taking it to stick with it i havent suffered with any major side effect since my body got used to it but one stick out my dream have become very long and vivid and i can recall them most night i wonder if anybody else ha experienced this anyway if it new to you and your unsure keep going
967,fluoxetine,hello all it is april th i started taking prozac in january i hated prozac i wa never depressed in the first place to begin with my psychiatrist prescribed me the pill they did not work for me i have not been taking the pill since april th so it been day and i feel better and beginning to be back to my normal way and more alert and le depressed i have read online that people who stopped taking it feel good at first then it start to kick in like emotion and stuff trying to get it out of ur system i guess withdrawal but i couldnt do prozac anymore made me very depressed and annoyed all the time didnt work for me
968,fluoxetine,i love it it helped my anxiety depression and obsessive compulsive disorder without a lot of side effect or even changing who i am
969,alprazolam,calm my anxiety better then anything else when i have anxiety attack and take one or two xanax i actually feel normal again and a lot more outgoing and im not so shy or afraid to meet and talk to new people that i may meet
972,xanax,ive tried everything for anxiety which is severe all the time xanax work only issue is the length of time it last i can feel the effect almost immediately within minute and continue to feel effect kicking in for a good hour after but after about hour i start to have rebound anxiety from it wearing off be careful of tolerance though since ive been on it ive had to increase x i started of with mg xday and am now on mg xday i dont want to change that but this seems to be a perfect it give me the relief i need a often a my body seems to need it i am so grateful for this drug a my panic is nonexistent where it hasnt been in year it been non stop never relief i finally feel relief
973,fluoxetine,i wa started at mg and after week with no improvement my it up too mg daily which put a small damper on the extreme depression i wa having but that wa only by making me feel nothing at allexcept maybe confusion and about month my dr changed me to lexapro which worked betternot much better but a little better
974,xanax,xanax is wonderful for anxiety and panic attack i can thank this medication for making me a normal person for being able to walk anywhere where there are people and feel absolutely no anxiety whatsoever it given me my life back
975,xanax,i am prescribed mg tablet a month brand name i take a half time a day and am also prescribed mg klonopin a month morning afternoon and night while the klonopin seems to aid in keeping the panicanxiety at bay and keeping me calm and relaxed the xanax is the real punch to panic attack and anxiety it take all my sadness and depression away and allows me to think about all the amazing thing i am working on not a a chore or a work but a creative idea being prescribed benzos is odd practice like klonopin time a day with a fast acting xanax
976,prozac,been on this for a few week now and i feel no better than i did before i started taking this gained weight and getting severe migraine
977,alprazolam,i have tried everything and this is the only thing besides ginko biloba that help i strongly recommend it id rather be a little sleepy at time then hear totally insane ringing in my ear all the time
978,xanax,my face hand and foot get numb and i dont know what to do im in school and freak out im a hairdresser so i cant just stop and breath in a bag this medicine worked for me hope it work for you
979,prozac,i have had social anxiety body dysmorphic disorder anorexia generalized anxiety disorder depression and obsessive compulsive disorder you name it i have had it since taking prozac two month ago my mood ha improved my thought are clearer i am more motivated about life like it actually mean something i have no more racing negative thought i am positive confident and enjoying life again mild side effect include dry mouth drowsiness wanting to sleep more and mild sexual dysfunction
980,alprazolam,this drug work well for anxiety and anxiety attack sometimes it doesnt work quickly enough for me but there really isnt a more fast acting drug in pill form that im aware of
981,fluoxetine,id suffered from anxiety and depression for many many year the anxiety led to trouble sleeping which made me depressed i wa focussing on the negative in my life and my circle of friend wa shrinking i began to feel worthless i am a musician but also a software engineer a job that is secure and pay well but give me no satisfaction i took fluoxetine in when stress at work brought my anxiety to a head i also used zolpidem to sleep i kept up this pattern for a couple of year quitting prozac and restarting regularly in october my sleep became awful and i wa regularly just walking out of work because i couldnt carry on i started prozac again and since then i have been on it it ha transformed my life
983,alprazolam,in my experience alprazolam can be extremely effective against anxiety considerably addictive and can easily create tolerance if the dosage are not carefully managed it should not be used a a sleeping aid since it tends to lose it hypnotic effect after some time of continuous usage to avoid the tolerance and addictive issue i recommend people to only take alprazolam in or before moment of anxiety for case of social anxiety i recommend one to take alprazolam hour before social interaction the dosage is in my view subjective thus one should discover his optimal dosage on an incremental basis i personally take to mg hour before leaving home and then sustain it throughout the day with mg individual dosage
985,prozac,prozac fluoxetine i have been taking mg every day for hot flash for year now it ha worked very well for me i also dont have the mood swing when i wa taking mg everyday it wa to much so i talked with my doctor and changed it around if you are having problem you may be taking to much talk to your doctor i did and i feel great
986,fluoxetine,this pill made my life hell it increased my suicidal ideation and i attempted a few time on it i felt dissociation and i became even more depressed they wouldnt let me off it however and actually increased my dosage to above the maximum adult dose before i finally wa able to stop taking it upon stopping the medication i felt better and wa le suicidal
987,prozac,prozac ha been a miracle for my anxiety my anxiety wa always like a constant static in my head this quotstaticquot ha caused me to have social anxiety ha well on prozac i feel my anxiety the static in my head isnt holding me back anymore i talk to people and i can finally be happy and free
988,alprazolam,xanax ha been a great thing for me i wa very scared to take it in the beginning because i had no idea how i wa going to feel but it really calmed me down after two week of thinking i wa going crazy or dying i had never experienced anything like this before but i had to get a blood transfusion for my anemia and all hell broke through my doctor gave me and i only take of that i break it in s i dont want to go to sleep just take the edge off so my advice to anyone that ha to take this even if you have a higher dose just take of it until you see how it will respond to your body i hope i could be a help to someone
989,prozac,i suffered extreme depression very much when my mum passed over and the doctor put me on these they helped me think straight and think about all the bad thing im still on them but only take one or two a week that keep me happy and normal
990,alprazolam,i have taken alprazolam for about week now and it ha really helped control my anxiety i had my first panic attack and then started getting them everyday and they would last all day for the first or day i had to take alprazolam every hour time a day then i would get the panic attack when i woke up am and then around pm so then i took pill a day for about day now i am down to one pill in the morning because i keep waking up with anxiety the alprazolam work in the first minutes but my anxiety get a little worse when i take it and then it get so much better the downside is the bad taste cause drowsiness loss of appetite and weight and is highly addictive great for temporary relief
992,prozac,i am a year old female who over the past year ha been diagnosed with major depression major anxiety ptsd and others the depression wa getting worse and worse until after many try with different medication my doctor prescribed prozac i truly believe this medicine saved my life
993,alprazolam,xanax ha really helped me relax i have severe anxiety depression and ptsd i take seroquel xr and recently my doctor switched me from xanax to atarax the atarax did not work at all i have suffered from anxiety for year and the only thing that ha been effective is xanax i would recommend this to anyone who ha moderate to severe anxiety it doe have a high addiction rate so be extremely careful when taking this
994,xanax,my anxiety gave me depersonalization whenever i take xanax it clear right up for me especially if i run out of klonopin it a great back up that help me when that sudden feeling of panic creep up on me
995,alprazolam,best thing ever i had panic attack so bad it feel like you are losing it but x mg tablet a day and they are now pretty much history
996,adderall,when i first began taking it it wa very intensemy heart raced i had too much energy for a while it wa greatthe racing heart and too much energy wore off after about a week it did become le useful over time but not to a great extent the trouble with adderall for me wa taking two a day at the quotrightquot time it wa really the second pill figuring out the right time to take it in a way so it would help me the rest of the day but not so late it would disturb my sleep since i hadhave a poor sleep schedule that wa challenging
997,xanax,wa prescribed xanax alprazolam for gad first few month were a godsend after i became dependent on them the doctor apparently not understanding the slightest thing about dependence upped the dosage several time i noticed that my anxiety seemed to be getting worse and i wa afraid to leave the house a problem i had never had before took me a while to realize the elephant in the room it wa the quotantianxietyquot drug after withdrawing from the drug which fortunately wa easy compared to the nightmare i have seen some people describe i noticed i felt le anxious and in general more quotalivequot if you feel like your anxiety isnt improving after long term benzo use the root of your problem may be the drug themselves

1027,fluoxetine,the drug work very good for depression and anxiety it also completely eliminates my headache i wa a chronic headache sufferer for year and ever since i started taking prozac i almost never have a headache i think this drug should be studied more a a medication to treat chronic headache a it increase serotonin in the brain and serotonin is a major factor in headache issue
1028,xanax,i had generalized anxiety disorder and xanax is the only drug ive found that work to alleviate the symptom i take mg no more than twice a week and within minute i feel calm and relaxed combine it with yoga and meditation and all your worry are gone i like to take a mg pill and immediately do some yoga and meditate for minute by the time youre done meditating youll feel great for a couple hour it help just knowing the pill is there if i want it i actually find that i take it much le than twice a week only or time a month if that i have no other side effect that i notice

1036,prozac,i have been on fluoxetine for about month after being diagnosed with dysthymia year old male and can positively say that it ha improved my quality of life in retrospect i have felt quotdysthymicquot probably since early adulthood and it took me so long to find out why i felt this way it wa only after doing my own internet search that i found a condition which wa exactly how i had been feeling for so long and this is the important point to note about dysthymia many people have it for so long that they just accept that the depressive feeling etc are part of their personality i had a few side effect early on mainly nausea but that subsided after a couple of week after a very long time in my life i feel positive
1037,adderall,i wa on adderall xr mg for about month and then developed hive couldve been the bottle couldve been a delayed reaction sulfa allergy i dont know but it wa perfect until then decreased appetite yes but thats not negative a far a im concerned doc switched me to vyvanse xr and i can tell you that while you will focus it not a focused a when on adderall at least for me decreased appetite but nothing like with adderall ive also been on evekeo mg tablet ive only tried that once and while it will definitely stimulate you closer to adderall i find there really not hyper focus just a lot of movement and staying awake if you havent tried it yet i would go with adderall xr first
1038,fluoxetine,this medication made me yawn frequently after two month i didnt notice any improvement in my mood but my jaw wa killing me from yawning and clenching my teeth which i dont normally do my friend and family also pointed out that i seemed more irritable and more likely to snap or be short tempered

1098,fluoxetine,i have currently been on prozac for the past month and it ha been a miracle drug i wa having severe anxiety and panic attack every day i couldnt drive a car by myself for fear of having a panic attack and losing control i couldnt go anywhere by myself and i could not stay home alone i am a year old female and once i turned i developed debilitating anxiety i tried zoloft and lexapro and both drug made my anxiety and panic attack sky rocket before starting prozac i wa a mess my anxiety prevented me from functioning i could barely even go to class or work without having a panic attack i am currently taking mg of prozac and i am doing so much better it is amazing
1101,adderall,i started taking adderall when i wa yo and it wa amazing for about year my dose started out at mgday in the beginning and after year wa up to mgday mg ir twice daily i started getting increasingly paranoid losing what seemed like more and more sleep with each passing month i kept thinking that i wa seeing red and blue light on my wall at night which made me think the cop were after me outside even though i didnt do anything that would require police assistance until one day when i lost my mind literally i wa taken by ambulance to the hospital and put on a hour psychiatric hold for which i ended up staying at the hospital almost week diagnosed with amphetamine induced schizoaffective disorder
1103,fluoxetine,i wa going through a very deep and dark depression for several month prozac wa the very antidepressant to work for me after about week i could tell the medication wa really working i wasnt having constant ocd related circling thought that made my depression worse and i wasnt on the verge of cry every second this pill is a miracle for me no side effect maybe weight gain but im also eating again when before i wa barely eating and dropped lb definitely take the medication at night because itll make you tired if you take it in the morning

1105,prozac,this is my third medication ive tried for my anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder i wa first on fluvoxamine and klonopin and those did nothing but make me a zombie a month into prozac while i wa feeling the side effect of dizziness and whatnot everything just turned back on literally it like someone turned the light on all i can say is it take time dont be discouraged also pay attention to what you take with it i wa on zoloft and wa getting extremely dizzy prozac doesnt agree with certain medication and definitely not caffeine for the most part though i went from having panic attack so bad they felt like heart attack to being completely calm and quotnormalquot
1106,fluoxetine,it made me crazy i couldnt eat or sleep or sit still
1110,fluoxetine,i wa previously on paxil mg i weaned myself off of it because i felt it wasnt working anymore and also the weight gain wa horrible lb in month i wa med free for about a week before i decided i definitely need something my depression and anxiety wa creeping it way back in and i just felt horrible overall went back to the dr and she gave me prozac mg my brain wa already adjusted to ssri so there wasnt much of a side effect period actually i dont recall any side effect at all but let me just tell you prozac fluoxetine is amazing my depression and anxiety are gone i go outside so much more this is the first time in my life i can ever remember waking up and thinking quotwhat can i do todayquot
1111,alprazolam,i have been on alprazolam for over year dose mg x i do not have any stress panic or anxiety but daily fight with the brain cry for this medicine i have terrible headache so take medicine for that i would love to get off these tab a it cause dependence i am worried about doctor tried cutting dose to mg x a day could not cope they then brought in an ssri and after first dose had the worst side effect so stopped that straight away
1114,fluoxetine,took prozac for about four year it worked in relieving my depression anger and anxiety but left me numb a well had almost no quotlowsquot but no quothighsquot either i had no side effect other than i now realize a reduced sex drive
1115,adderall,before i found out i had add i had poor grade and i just couldnt sit still for minute or i would find myself sitting there at the end of class not knowing what happened because i quotzonedquot out i wa put on adderall towards the end of my junior year i graduated last may with a gpa i say this drug worked wonder
1116,xanax xr,tried this for a few day to help with anxiety instead of my usual klonopin at bedtime do not just switch to another benzo without transitioning had bad nightmare all night and wa a wreak the following day might be good for some people and maybe more for daytime anxiety but definitely didnt help my sleep even when taking a higher dose than i normally do of klonopin on a side note dont rely on benzos longterm gt month you will quickly dig yourself a hole a tolerance inevitably build and your sleep and mental state will be worse than when you started been on benzos for gt year and im slowly reducing mine and it suck pretty bad get on something safer and nontolerance building the sooner the better
1117,prozac,wa always stressed and depressed and blew up on people i love give prozac week it changed my life ive been on lexapro and cymbalta on mg prozac couldnt imagine life without it everything just go my way now and im super happy and can think clearly but somehow am still myself and with no side effect it amazing
1118,fluoxetine,i used to constantly think about food my thought would be racing whether to stuff my face or not eat at all when i started mg prozac it took a while and until i realized i didnt think about it anymore very glad my mind is off food for once
1119,xanax,i thank xanax for making me a better mom i wa mean to everyone around me and i took the motto quotthis is who i amquot to heart it wa not until my mother died after having my third child that i actually realized my angry childhood and anger in this world wa not to blame on any one but my own feeling after taking xanax and some therapy i am a new person i would not be able to live without it i do not abuse it i only take the amount prescribed by my doctor and no more i also take paxil which helped me a lot a well but without the xanax i would not be living participating with my life and most of all my child i read to them now we go on picnic and wilderness hike i love my life now
1120,fluoxetine,i had a neutral experience on prozac my second ssri tried for anxiety and depression prozac did not really help me but it did not do any harm i experienced very few side effect aside from increased anxiety for the first week or so however i wa unable to come off of my klonopin because it did not help my anxiety and i wa more suicidal after month of being on it than when i started it
1122,fluoxetine,it took about day to kick in but wa the saving grace of getting me through postpartum depression and being able to function normally with my son
1124,prozac,i didnt realize how stressed i wa until id been taking prozac for week and compared myself to what i wa like the previous month id been stressed for a really long time now le stressed im more focused and productive in work i didnt think that wa possible im also creative again i feel i have a chemical imbalance that needed redressed i always thought having to take anti depressant wa a sign of failure but now i realize it just a chemical imbalance good luck
1128,adderall,this drug wa prescribed to after ritilin didnt work well this medication helped my adhd but the side affect were unbearable cotton mouth irritability anxiety panic attack i seemed like the con outweighed the pro much more successful than ritilin but not enough my doctor decided to try vyvanse a new version of adderall with le side effect and better outcome for treatment plus no crash after dinner
1129,prozac,prozac got rid of lot of my circular thought about how awful i wa and helped my mind to concentrate better on school work however i quotcaredquot le about what i wa learning and studied for test not longterm memory prozac helped me to branch out and broaden my friendship circle though the quality of my friendship wa more superficial than before prozac took a huge toll on my body i had painful muscle cramp in my leg back arm and neck i always had large bag under my eye and fell asleep during the day because i slept very lightly on this medicine
1130,alprazolam,i wa when i had my first panic attack it wa so scary i didnt know what wa happening to me it got to the point that i had anxiety every single minute of my day i became house bound for the next yr i would not step foot outside my house i felt like the world around me wa a dream i now know this is called derealization something that happens when anxiety is at it worst at it peek my mother took me to her psychiatrist that wa the best day of my life i wa prescribed mg xanax x per day i started to flourish i starting living again and slowly getting back out into society i am now i have a loving husband kid and am still on xanax but my dosage is much lower microgram in the morning or when necessary
1131,prozac,i have suffered from depression since i wa i am now ive tried lexapro and celexa but lexapro wa too expensive and celexa quit working for me after a few month prozac ha completely taken away all suicidal ideation which i have had almost daily since i wa and ha made life so much easier for me to handle i cant believe that i have been missing out all this time it hard to believe that other people really live this way without constant depression and anxiety every day i am so happy i found this medication i did not know if it wa possible to completely get rid of those thought amazing medicine
1133,adderall,im a yr old male i started taking adderall about month ago for the first week i didnt notice much change then i noticed that when i took the medication in the morning suddenly i had a lot more energy and it seemed like i could concentrate better and not a agitated about life in general i take me nd dose at lunch time the increase in my energy level wa keeping me moving more during the day so it allowed me to rest better at night every morning when i wake i go straight for the adderall overall i think adderall ha improved my quality of life and i think adderall should be prescribed to the aged for the same effect it not going to work the same for all so close monitoring for day on a per day
1134,fluoxetine,only been a week on mg and i already feel can not wait for the future week and to be thank you god for prozac
1135,fluoxetine,about four month ago my anxiety became very bad which eventually led to me becoming depressed i spent my day in bed cry and anxious i had to take time off work and my social life became nonexistent i wa eventually put on fluoxetine at mg and then eventually put on mg the side effect i had wa extreme tiredness strange dream and an increase in anxiety which went away after about four week so if youre having side effect hang in there a it can take anywhere from week for this medication to work my side effect went and three month after taking this medication im a completely different person im motivated my anxiety ha eased so much and my depression ha gone it ha given me my life back
1136,adderall,i am a yr old female and have taken adderall xr mg for over a year now adderall ha helped me tremendously before starting it could barely get out of bed had no interest in anything not even living couldnt focus nearly a zombie a long a i take it im a happy functional person some issue with insomnia but nothing unmanageable dont take it on my day off to avoid building a tolerance however have become totally dependent on this medicine recently tried to stop taking it second day without it i wa useless and by third day i wa like a zombie
1137,fluoxetine,the first three week at mg wa tempestuous at best however i truly felt a if i wa turning the corner so to speak i suffer from somatic anxiety more then the mental part of it fatigue and headache were common sleep disturbance also i had some great half day after increasing the med to mg a day for two month i decided to drop back down to mg i lost a fair bit of weight the first week around kilo however after month ive put it back on and then some will be discussing other option with my docter soon i would also say that anxiety or manic episode were increased during the dosage increase which wa treated with clonazapam
1138,adderall xr,im so much more focused at work and home but i noticed if i dont eat im a space cadet eating is very important otherwise youre just wasting a good medicine i also have alot more energy by far i work the overnight shift at work and it help very much thanks adderall
1139,adderall xr,this medicine is amazing i took it about hour ago and still going strong
1141,prozac,ha not worked for my belumia i still throw up almost every meal i dont throw up after taking it because i know i need it
1143,xanax,hello everybody im only giving xanax a out of because it doesnt seem to have any effect on me ive been getting it every month for a few year i started it back when after taking paxil for a decade it started to decrease it effectiveness and my anxiety and panic attack were beginning to reappear my psych switched me to effexor and while we were figuring out the best dose in combination with buspar i wa desperate to have a fastacting solution to the panic when i felt it coming on he gave me xanax but it didnt help with the overwhelming anxiety unless i took a few of them and even then the improvement wa minimal to moderate when i found the magic dosage amount with the effexor my anxiety all but disappeared
1144,adderall,i have adult adhd im now and have been on adderall mg time a day for the past year it really helped me if you just take it responsibly you dont have any real problem the only thing i still get dry mouth
1145,alprazolam,i think xanax work great taking it along with an antidepressant right now i am currently taking mg of xanaz along with mg of celexa i believe it ha helped me out it so many way i used to have anxiety and panic attack pretty much all day or part of the day that i wa awake i havent felt this good about myself in a long time sometimes i would get a panic attack just from walking in a public place such a a supermarket and then came the heavy breathing and the nervous feeling out of nowhere but the xanax put all the feeling to rest i know it a narcotic and it can be abused and it also can cause dependency but if used the right way i know it can work for some of the worst condition of depression
1146,alprazolam,started at took it until it the only medication that ever worked for me i wa a guinea pig for month day after taking it it wa a miracle medicine i actually called my dr thanking him i had finally gotten the elephant off my chest never abused it sometimes dealing with anxiety so a not to get addicted are there any drs left that will prescribe real working medication for people who really need but do not abuse it i do not need a psychiatrist i just need a one put it one in hand just in case doctor today think it taboo to even mention this medication im not nor do i abuse it i take a mg at night and sleep like a rock hey drs this medicine work
1147,fluoxetine,most of my life i have struggled with severe panic attack general anxiety ptsd amp moderate depression been on med twice before until i felt better amp then i would stop taking them this last time it had been close to a year that i had been suffering again before i decided to reluctantly go back on med i tried celexa again it worked kinda okay in the past but this time it made no improvement for me saw the doc who switched me to prozac all i can say is wow best yet i feel like my old happy self after only month mg the first week the second and mg the last two give it time to work amp be patient it might make you feel a bit off amp not better at first but it is a miracle drug these bad feeling will pas hang in there
1148,fluoxetine,this medication coupled with cognitive behavioural therapy ha helped me so much in dealing with my social anxietypanic disorder which i have had to deal with for over year by lifting my mood and clearing my head this medication had allowed me to think more clearly and rationally about what it is im panicking about then using my cognative behavioural therapy technique i am them able to calm myself down and talk myself out of that horrible feeling hyperventilatingpounding heartlight headedness i had previously used propanolol to calm me down when i felt stressed but a this is no longer working i had to try something else i wa put on mg st two week i had a bit of sickness trouble sleeping but that passed
1150,alprazolam,in general i am anxious and overthink thing to the point of having racing thought sweating and in social situation these symptom are exacerbated and my mind would go blank i always thought this is just how i am and it suck until one day it all came together and i put a name to it social anxiety i wa always afraid of pill and all the addiction story u hear but after a panic attack i thought it time i started a low dose and only take it when i really really need it about time a week omg how it changed my life if u dont abuse it like some people it doe it job sometimes ill go a whole week without it and sometimes ill use it day it varies but it help me feel way le nervous and focus and really changed my life
1151,xanax xr,have been taking for a few month now with great result little dosage changing i tried ssri and other medication without much luck other than feeling down or drained used trazadone for sleep i wa living like a zombie with xanax the sedation wore off after roughly day which wa the only thing i can complain off i have been doing better at school le worrisome tic better sleep instead of waking up screaming longer acting wa better for me than a rollercoaster ride of taking a lorazapam or xanax same dose worked wonderfully for year and now i just found that this time of my life i needed something longacting that i wouldnt have to think about my anxiety or worry about it anymore
1152,xanax,i have been taking a combination of mg xanax time a day mg extended release xanax once daily and mg klonopin twice daily i have found that this combination of medication and xanax itself ha helped me get my mind back on the thing that matter in my life get over my fear and make an enormous amount of friend in my life although the only problem is that my doctor now tell me after month of taking this dose that he think the depakote mg a day is helping me and that he is going to start taking me off the benzodiazapines i tried to see if i would be able to get off of them and live normally i found myself worse than before the medication with severe withdrawal symptom
1153,fluoxetine,work great for anxiety depression ocd pm ibs coping with stress fibromyalgia sleeping better low immunity from stress headache prevention help you think positive rather than negative thought negative side effect include daytime fatigue dry mouth agitationhyperactivity harder to orgasm harder to feel in loveemotional numbness vivid dream

1161,xanax,a god send for my untreatable insomnia only side effect that prevents me from taking it more often is the testosterone suppressing effect i spend a lot of time working out and eating right and noticed my strength and body composition took a very noticeable nose dive a few month after starting on it i have used mg nightly for almost a year on the plus side it ha helped me get the deep restorative sleep i struggle to get
1162,prozac,this medication made me yawn frequently after two month i didnt notice any improvement in my mood but my jaw wa killing me from yawning and clenching my teeth which i dont normally do my friend and family also pointed out that i seemed more irritable and more likely to snap or be short tempered

1166,prozac,i wa on lexapro which made me suicidal and started prozac mg it wa easy to wean off the lexapro after taking my pill in the morning i immediately felt severe drowsiness heavy eyelid and tiredness i started during my holiday and took a nap every afternoon but once back to work the tiredness wa unbearable especially in the afternoon i could hardly keep my eye open and have never drank so much espresso and energy drink the espresso did not even bring me to shaking whatsoever nor relieved my drowsiness after week and day i quit but side effect lasted for at least a week i must say it lifted my depression
1169,adderall xr,i used to take a high dosage time release tablet of another drug if i took it when i woke up say oclock i would inevitably go through an anxious and depressing period everyday around pm my psychiatrist prescribed me adderall xr and adderall to see if i wouldnt go through this down period i am so much happier now adderall permit me to be focused le impulsive and organized while lessening up the side effect which i got with the other drug i have an appetite but am not an impulsive eater
1170,prozac,i cant say enough about how much this medicine ha helped me with depression i spent year in and out of deep depression i wa finally diagnosed with depression and post traumatic stress disorder and started prozac at mg then went up to mg i knew it wa helping but i didnt fully realize how much until i forgot to take it for about day then i started to feel the hopeless feeling i get with depression and i havent missed a dose since im one of the lucky one with no negative side effect my libido is better than ever and ive actually lost a few pound i sleep great and wake up every morning feeling rested and more positive about life than i ever have before

1172,adderall xr,work great for my adhd it the first drug i wa prescribed for it and i think ill be sticking with it the only effect other than helping with focus that ive had so far are some extra energy and a little bit of a reduction in appetite ill have to switch to immediate release next month though since the extended release pill are still a little bit expensive
1176,prozac,prozac ha taken my body ache away prevents me from obsessing over what someone else did or said help with anxiety depression stress and cry a lot of the other medication i had an allergic reaction to or they made me lethargic and gain weight problem with short term memory and retaining new information but that could be my age of
1177,alprazolam,it made me tired and didnt relieve my anxiety
1178,alprazolam,xanax alprazolam is a good drug for anxiety and panic disorder is wonderful while youre taking it but i know to leave this medicine is so painful and ha many unpleasant effect on the withdrawal it work great for me

1211,fluoxetine,i have been on fluoxetine for about month after being diagnosed with dysthymia year old male and can positively say that it ha improved my quality of life in retrospect i have felt quotdysthymicquot probably since early adulthood and it took me so long to find out why i felt this way it wa only after doing my own internet search that i found a condition which wa exactly how i had been feeling for so long and this is the important point to note about dysthymia many people have it for so long that they just accept that the depressive feeling etc are part of their personality i had a few side effect early on mainly nausea but that subsided after a couple of week after a very long time in my life i feel positive
1212,prozac weekly,i have had major depressive dissorder since i wa year of age had pretty much come to term with the fact that this wa going to be lifelong thing been to therapy group and tried other med like regular amp generic prozac plus took paxil for a little while prozac weekly ha been the only thing that ha made a huge difference for me other than being very careful about eating healthy i forget to take daily med so only taking it once a week is a bonus the first time i took prozac weekly it took about week to really quotkick inquot but once it did the difference wa like night amp day is this how normal people feel you mean i can feel like this everyday not sure if it will be the same for you just my positive experience good luck
1213,alprazolam,in a case of emergency i would take xanax during the day but i usually take it at night to go to bed and to stop the anxiety and panic attack it make me feel so sleepy i dont know how anyone can take it during the day i felt high a a kite it work thats for sure
1214,xanax,i noticed my memory wa very much affected on xanax this is the quickest working benzo in my opinion but doe not last long also the withdrawal from xanax were more severe than the withdrawal from the other benzos ive been on it work great for some people but not so much for me
1215,adderall,this ha worked very well for me am able to get thing done without being all over the place and actually feel great overall
1217,prozac,after trying celexa which helped my anxiety but not my depression my doctor reccomended prozac i wa in a very bad state at the time and wa up for anything to make me feel better after taking it for about week i started having extreme suicidal thought everyday which wa very unlike me even with major depression i told my doctor and she said she felt she wa just under treating me and uped my doe another mg after another week i had to put myself into a hospital because i felt i had no control over the suicidal part of me i have been off of prozac for over month now and have had little to no suicidal thought although my depression and anxiety ha worsened from the experience i feel
1218,adderall xr,ever since i started taking the adderall i noticed i am more active focused and determined to achieve my goal it help me mentally and physically so of course i definitely like being on it
1220,xanax,i started taking xanax in after having a heart catheter that went wrong i went into v tach after that i suffered from arrhythmia daily and panic attack ending up in the hospital a few time first the arrhythmia start which brings on panic attack i realize now this is all ptsd my new internist put me on xanax at mg which had little result then upped to mg which i take one twice a day year later im still on it taking same dosage tried going off a few time unsuccessfully new doctor lowered it to one day hoping for the best
1224,adderall,i have taken adderall for over a year and i have had great result i take mg twice a day i stay on task and accomplish so much more in a day initially i wa shaky and jittery and not sure about adderall but it wa stopped and i feel the full benefit of the drug the only side effect i would tell someone about would be dry mouth loss if appetite good for me though and sometimes hard to get to sleep at night these are trivial given the amount of benefit i see from adderall
1225,xanax,xanax ha helped me tremedously i do not suffer from any of the side effect that are listed since being on this drug for my anxiety i have been given part of my life back i didnt like to be in crowd of people or go to social event and since i am on this medicine i no longer suffer from these anxiety
1226,adderall xr,i take adderall xr mg time per day when i started i worked great a long a i took it before noon afternoon i wa up all night after about month i could not tell that i had taken anything my dr added mg intuitive it seems to work ok i am about to the th month and back to i cant tell weather or not i take it i do not have a past of any dependency or addiction except nicotine so i am not sure where i will go from here all in all it is a good med for adhd the only side effect are dry mouth and grinding my teeth a it wear off
1227,fluoxetine,i am and this is the th drug i have taken in the last year the side effect from everything made the stressed out anxious feeling almost more appealing from paxil effexor zoloft i am sure there wa another one or in there somewhere i think that i should have been put on a low dose of prozac a long time ago i have only taken it for a couple week or so but i dont feel the side effect of the other medication there is no longer a veil over me i feel good but still like myself i am hoping this is how i continue to feel my kid and fiance deserve to have a happy me in their life i am happy for those who have found what they need to cope for those who havent dont give up
1228,prozac,day on mg i am edgy and wobbly no appetite forced myself to eat so i am eating le taking advantage of that because i am also a diabetic and hard to go to sleep i am sticking with the medicine have some relief of bad thought hope it get better
1229,alprazolam,only thing that keep me sane and under my own control
1230,xanax,i had the worst anxiety imaginable that manifested to agoraphobia and i wa a prisoner for year it a long story but xanax saved my life or rather gave me my life back in any event those that suffer daily anxiety or gad general anxiety disorder are better off using an moa inhibitor a a maintenance medication and xanax a an emergency medication im on effexor daily mg that took about week to start working but when it did is too wa a miracle i did have side effect when i started but my doctor told me to quothang in therequot because the side effect are usually just temporary and they were with the exception of weight gain in which i control with exercise and diet which gave me another side effect better health
1232,fluoxetine,been on prozac before and worked well left it too long before seeking help this time never felt this bad extreme anxiety depression and feeling of doom and obsessive racing thought first week in and making me worse but this is to be expected i guess doc upped them to mg so will see what happens cry all morning wake early sweating and anxious feel sick lost a lot of weight want my life back
1233,alprazolam,i have been on xanax for almost year when i first began experiencing panic attack it ha been a wonder drug for helping me cope with my panic issue it ha also helped lessen my anxiety in social situation you can only be prescribed so much of this controlled substance and you need to take it correctly now if i take one extra a day and run out early i experience worse anxiety than i did before i even began the medication it great for anxiety but be careful how you use it
1235,adderall,when i began taking adderall in my early s from dose one i could say i feel quotnormalquot for the first time in my life since i wa a young boy i wa happy and life had meaning and a reason it allowed me to become productive and i loved this new feeling of well being in both mind and body it came after a decade of severe depression anxiety and panic state and a multitude of psych issue and i wa like a person on the outside but inside a disease of agonizing mental anguish and physically i hurt of severe pain but no physical evidence that i wa like a year old young man who wa only alive because i would not die a tablet of adderall changed my life and it is my key to life worth living
1236,prozac,i wa suffering from generalized anxiety disorder with some panic it wa a miserable situation and although i gutted it out for many year i finally decided to try med my doctor prescribed prozac mg initially im not going to lie those first couple of week were rough it actually made me more anxious and pretty jittery sleep wa not restful but then just about the time i wa going to give up week into it and try something else i started feeling better eventually i felt a lot better i now take mgdaily and i feel like i got my life back i dont think i realized how small my life had become until the anxiety abated for someone who can gut out the initial few week it is so worth it
1237,fluoxetine,for the last year my pmt ha lasted week of the month common symptom fatigue anxiety no motivation depression and angerrage screaming at my little boy this wasnt the sort of mum i wa going to be took a while to persuade my dr to let me try this i take mg from day of my cycle for day and i feel like a different person mostly the rage ha gone i feel like me again it take about dos to kick in so i usually start taking it on day only side effect wa indigestion so i dont take it before bed wish id known about it year ago
1238,adderall xr,i am im studying in physic and i have been on adderall for almost year now i started at mg and i am now at mg it wa good the first year very effective but now i dont think it really help i feel sleepy with it and i lost attention very quickly i dont think the dose is the problem i feel the effect and i think that increasing the dose will augment the anxiety cause by it i noticed that each time i had to augment the dos the side effect wa worst im gon na return to ritalin tonight it wa way more effective or maybe another one with methylphenidate concerta didnt work for me maybe biphentin should
1240,xanax,with the death of my mom in june i immediately started having nausea and vomiting couldnt eat couldnt concentrate i thought i wa dying myself every time i tried to go to sleep i could feel my heart beating furiously through my chest i wanted to die myself my doctor finally prescribed xanax after a horrible episode of just trying to drive home from his office i had to stop about time because i wa cry so bad he said i wa suffering from ptsd without xanax i do not think i would have been able to handle all the legal paperwork that i had to do plus work now in we had to close our business and have lost my job the whole episode ha started up again i hope the increased dose will help and i can continue my life
1241,prozac,i had slipped into a depression following some traumatic life event the morning were worse and often unbearable i became suicidal i wa also agitated i wa desperate and went to gp and prescribed fluoxetine mg i have been taking them for six week and feel so much better mood ha lifted and morning depression ha stopped it saved my life side effect were a sore throat and cold symptom which lasted four day yawning a well best thing i ever did wa admit i had a problem and take medicine

1243,alprazolam,still use a regular xanax at time when thing get bad but the xr is amazing for those time where i cant afford the drowsiness xr is just a nice steady dose to take the edge off and no side effect would recommend
1244,xanax,working well to help me relax and go to sleep

1253,adderall xr,it took a while to find the right problem then the right medicine then the right dosage but once we did even my husband could tell the difference and i could too it wa an immediate difference the next day with the clonazepam i felt an instant calmness and togetherness that i had not felt before i take mg x mg xr in the morning with clonazepam mg tab because i have panic attack and anxiety sometimes then mg clonazepam at night which relaxes me and i am able to not have nightmare and can sleep without the medicine including the lexapro mg i have terrible depression nightmare can not concentrate the post traumatic stress disorder take over and the hypervigilence is awful the drug have made such a positive difference and my husband agrees

1403,prozac,this is my th review since prozac ha almost completely eliminated my anxiety episode weight loss ceased some time ago and i gained weight back most likely due to drinking appetite is normal bowel movement are more normal than eversorry but when i had severe anxiety that wa a big problem i can speak in large group setting with no problem travel without issue and deal with stressful situation effectively overall i feel great with no side effect con drinking can be an issue definitely drink moderately eat before drinking and drink plenty of water alcohol can sneak up on you and cause drowsiness or blackout believe me i know
1404,alprazolam,it work great for panic attack but is horrible a you feel it wear off klonopin is much better
1405,alprazolam,i have been on xanax since my first attack in my mid to late s im now at first i wa taking mg x a day it worked wonder for many year then my mother wa dying of cancer my anxiety came back fold also my child became a severe alcoholic and almost died i now take mg x a day just to cope with the daily anxiety and it help me to feel normal in a un normal world unfortunately now my new med doc want to start weaning me off which ha caused me more anxiety i feel dont fix whats not broken but i wa told at my age it could cause me to start falling down or lose my balance and become forgetful really please those thing come with age anyway ive never abused my med im not falling down or forgetting either

1451,alprazolam,life saver for me but only because i take it when i truly need it i suffer from day to day anxiety but i do not take it for that i try to get rid of anxiety other natural way but i do suffer from severe panic attack especially night time so i only take it when i am having an attack i am on the lowest dose possible and i can get away with taking even just half of that sometimes it take the edge off very fast and i feel so much better shortly after take it on average time a month sometime le rarely more extremely addictive med so i urge you to stay away from it for daily use or if you have an addictive personality

1479,alprazolam,i love xanax i wish i could take it daily but my doctor wont prescribe it to me for daily use because she doesnt want me to get addicted to it i only take xanax on rare occasion when i wa extremely distraught it made me feel better instantly ive only taken mg but that wa more than enough to make everything seem great i wa aware that my problem still existed but i wasnt overwhelmed by them it made me feel warm and happy ive taken other drug before and xanax is by far the best choice

1493,alprazolam,when you are depressed it hard to want to take the effort to feel better such a exercise walking friend company the xr version i feel is le for panic attack prevention instead and more of a mood elevator daily social anxiety is curbed and being able to go outside the house and hang with friend ha helped my depression so much it help prevent and end negative thought throughout the day and make your brain to think calmly it last about hour or so then i take an ir in the afternoon to relax and fall asleep the best part is not having to carry around a controlled substance all day
1494,alprazolam,i asked my doctor if he could give me something a i had been under stress and anxiety for some time i take mg of xanax twice a day i take it about hour before i go to bed so i can relax and sleep not sure if the xanax is causing some weight gain or not

1599,xanax xr,when you are depressed it hard to want to take the effort to feel better such a exercise walking friend company the xr version i feel is le for panic attack prevention instead and more of a mood elevator daily social anxiety is curbed and being able to go outside the house and hang with friend ha helped my depression so much it help prevent and end negative thought throughout the day and make your brain to think calmly it last about hour or so then i take an ir in the afternoon to relax and fall asleep the best part is not having to carry around a controlled substance all day
1601,fluoxetine,im in my late s and have always had anxiety spike but in the last year my job ha become overwhelming to me and i would wake up vomiting and in anxiety attack i had always gone to therapist who would give me exercise which would work at first but after a while i could not handle it found a dr who gave me mg and i can not tell you how much it ha helped almost from the get go my spike have calmed down and i can control my feeling i havent really had any stress lately at work so i havent tested that out but just in my every day working where i would just feel anxiety it ha helped the one problem is that my sex drive is very low not gone but low
1602,prozac,tried zoloft and lexapro but had stomach problem side effect for month i tried the generic prozac mg and had a month of horrible side effect until week it finally worked help so much no attack and only have a little anxiety once in a while worth it
1603,alprazolam,i have a panic disorder and have been taking xanax for over yr now never had to increase my dose and finally can live a normal life the doctor had tried all different medication and this is the only one that worked
1604,alprazolam,i have suffered with tinnitus and mild hearing loss for the past year i had gotten to the point of completely quotlosingquot it the constant ringing buzzing etc wa driving me insane and causing anxiety my doctor prescribed xanax for the anxiety but it clearly brought the tinnitus under control i no longer suffer from anxiety because im no longer stressed by the continuous noise xanax get a bad rap but it saved me and made my life normal again many thanks to my doctor
1605,xanax,i am on a mg dose of xanax on and off for about a year for imsonia night panic and generalized anxienty and i can say this is the best pill worked great for me it help me feel calm allday and relaxed during the night so i can get the sleep i need give me energy during the day when i drink green tea early morning
1606,fluoxetine,prozac saved my life mg im on week three i wa out of work for month and couldnt think clear then on the third week i woke up finally got out of my bed and pursued looking for work got hired that same day yay i encourage you to stay on prozac for three week to take effect
1607,xanax,my doctor prescribed medication for depression i have tried three different kind and had terrible side effect i am taking xanax occasionally when anxiety or panic occur and it work for me just great generic version alprazolam take a little longer to kick in
1608,fluoxetine,prozac completely changed my personality to worse i wa a worrying anxious person and after month of prozac i stopped caring about anything starting having agressive bout of being irritable and also killed my libido regret having taken this therapy is the answer for me and i am sure for maaaaaaany people who take this medicine
1610,alprazolam,i tried almost everything but suffered from horrific panic disorder for year finally i decided to take xanax i wa afraid of getting addicted but i m so glad i used this it because i have been panic free for the last month i dont take xanax everyday anymore at all i did not get addicted at all i take it only if i feel like i start getting anxious i thank xanax xanax is the only thing helped me
1611,fluoxetine,prozac got rid of lot of my circular thought about how awful i wa and helped my mind to concentrate better on school work however i quotcaredquot le about what i wa learning and studied for test not longterm memory prozac helped me to branch out and broaden my friendship circle though the quality of my friendship wa more superficial than before prozac took a huge toll on my body i had painful muscle cramp in my leg back arm and neck i always had large bag under my eye and fell asleep during the day because i slept very lightly on this medicine
1613,fluoxetine,i suffer bout of depression and have been prescribed prozac this medication doe stop the weepiness and severe irritability that i suffer however it made me feel quotnothingquot rather than good additionally the side effect that i suffer on prozac are not worth the marginal lack of hopeless feeling i felt nauseous hollow scattered and my libido completely vanished this led to marital stress so i went off of it on my own i think it is the wrong chemical for my type of brain chemistry or depression
1614,prozac,my experience a a man on prozac for year overall it seems to work the best in relieving me of lifethreatening depression in addition it ha the fewest side effect among all the other medication with these two very significant exception while taking it nearly remove your libido which can ruin most relationship if you stop taking prozac youll experience for the next week the strange sensation of electric current zipping inside your head with every change in thought or visual focus you make if you stay on prozac it probably best to be single instead make new and real friendship which prozac allows you the freedom to do good luck
1617,alprazolam,i have dealt with depression anxiety social phobia or social anxiety which ever label they want to use for it these day i have dealt with these issue pretty much since kindergarten well mainly the extreme social phobiaanxiety at that time which they used to just call quotshyquot when i wa and wa seeing a psychologist he diagnosed me a having agoraphobia im guessing because they really didnt have the term quotsocial phobiaanxietyquot at that time i finally started taking paxil and it worked good for yr then i maxed out on dosage and it stopped working tried all the other ssrisssnris effexor xr worked best but didnt help anxietyor social phobia issue got on klonopin then xanax eventually benzodiazepine are life saver for socialphobia
1619,prozac,been on this medicine for week now and definitely starting to feel le anxious and im not making a mountain out of a molehill anymore also not a afraid in social situation and ocd that someone will break in my house and kidnap me and my kid is gone and i can actually sleep at night now i hope this continues because living in constant fear is no way to live
1620,fluoxetine,ive been on prozac since april before that i wa on lexapro for year lexapro helped with my depression but did nothing for my anxiety i have post traumatic stress disorder and a side effect of ptsd is obsessive compulsive disorder anxiety depression trichotillomania and binge eating prozac ha almost eliminated all of that no more depression very mild anxiety my ocd and trichotillomania are under control i have also lost lb but i do not know if this is because of the medication the only side effect i experienced wa being trapped in nightmare this only happened the first month i started
1621,fluoxetine,i wa depressed since i could remember always low energy and just wanting something to kill me didnt matter but prozac help me a lot i still have my bad day but they arent a severe of frequent thanks prozac
1622,alprazolam,i have been on every medication out there to help with my anxietydepression i wa taking effexor which worked at first but i noticed that my head wa just filled with unnecessary garbage to say the least my dr took me off of the effexor and replaced it with brintellix and saphris which really helped my mood and depression but my anxiety wa still affecting me to the point i thought i wa having a stroke he prescribed my mg of xanax time a day and wow the difference is night and day i am actually able to function normally and am so relieved im still scared to be taking it because of the addiction that can come with it but with my drs guidance i am feeling better about this medication my anxiety ha subsided grateful
1623,alprazolam,ive been taking xanax for anxiety and it s life saver work really well always carry a bottle in my purse the only con are that it can make me sleepy at time and it ha an unpleasant aftertaste
1624,fluoxetine,started taking prozac for bulimiadepression about three week ago the first week i wa on a low dose mg with no positive or negative side effect the second week i wa on mg and wa le depressed but still not a positive effect for my problem im at the end of week and on mg and i can really see a difference now havent had the need to bingepurge in day and my appetite ha decreased to where i only eat the regular mealsday because of this ive actually lost lb also im more motivated to do thing now with this medicine im very happy with this medication so far only negative is ive noticed it been harder to go to the bathroom not sure if it the medicine but it the only thing i can think of
1625,xanax,i have been on xanax for about ten year and now it is ha had to come to a screeching hault at first mg three time a day wa great ii could work go into social setting and even to store it gradually got up to mg time a day for about year then came the beginning of the end i had began using more and more of this wonder drug and i ran out horrible withdrawal symptom beginning with night sweat not sleeping confusion and finally seizure not to mention the mental twist and game my mind played on me now i am on klonopin and it taken the edge off today i dont get the wonder drug feeling and im not having seizure we will see careful with use of this medicine
1627,xanax,i like to think of this a headache medicine take only when you have one this medicine should be used in emergency only it is not for taking everyday for that i recommend something that ha a longer shelflifethat take longer to break down like klonopin because of xanax short wait time and short shelflife it can make you feel like an addict if you forget a dose in le than hr you can experience worse symptom of anxiety because they come without warning or provocation instant panic attack inability to think or work etc however a a panic attack reducer or for the instant release of an intense anxietyrelated event i do highly recommend it
1630,fluoxetine,had anxiety ever sense i can remember mostly manageable with out medication in may i had a panic attack at work and decided to start fluoxetine again i experience alot of physical symptom that go with anixty so i wanted to get control of it the st and second week were ok just a hit jittery but the rd and th week were awful bizarre dream sweat uncontrollable shaking and cry and sick feeling i also notice a very tight throat which is something i hadnt had before eventually one friday evening all the panic from the last horrid week stopped then i have the up ever since i have been told that you experience a low before u get the high just got to ride it out still have very minor anxity sometimes
1631,xanax,thankfully i only took this med for a few week and at the lowest dose possible i wa taking mg time a day for a few week until my long term anxiety medication started to kick in this medication truly doe help for extreme anxiety and panic attack but should only be used shortterm the use of this medication for any longer than a month on a daily basis is a recipe for disaster this drug can be very addicting and is really hard to come off after longtime use luckily i researched this drug and knew this shortly after taking it so i wa aware because the doctor never informed me of the risk
1632,prozac,after about month or so all of the side effect that i wa having disappeared it work great for my pm anxiety and even help me to think clearer add just be patient one thing that i dont like is the weight gain but plump and happy is better than thin and cranky
1634,fluoxetine,this is by far the best antidepressant i have ever taken i took mg brand name only and it completely took away my depression it wasnt a quothappyquot pill it just helped me to cope with the normal ups and down of life like a regular person it helped me to see that thing that used to send me into suicidal despair were really not the end of the world i wa more confident and assertive it helped me to take baby step out of the black pit i wa in before and try new thing and be social again it did turn out that i had some kind of allergy to the pill which is the only reason i quit taking it i would highly recommend trying brand name only start out on a low dose and hang in there for week before you decide if you like it or not
1635,alprazolam,ive had a ringingbuzzing in my right ear only for several year it been stressful i could barely function my doctor prescribed alprazolam so i could relax amp sleep at night but day when the ringing wa unusually louddistracting i decided to just try using it during the daytime i took of a tablet and within a very short time le than hour the ringing wa gone it seems to be effective for about hour i also take my usual tablet for sleeping and my anxiousness about tinnitus is under control for the most part i dont understand but im too happy to question it my prescription is for tablet xday so im on the low end when taking only
1636,fluoxetine,took this a i wa having bad anxiety and insomnia waking up early constantly with that uncomfortable tight chest feeling and just having no energy seemed to work for the first day then i got really depressed i started at mg and went up mg a week til i hit mg i have been super depressed more anxious wa extremely nauseous and could barely eat for almost week and my sleep hasnt improved at all after almost week on this stuff i am a mess and dont feel like myself at all weening off and trying something else i got up to mg tried to get to but just felt too horrible
1637,adderall,when i first started taking it it helped me immensely with my adhd pretty quickly however it stopped working for one thing it give me crazy mood swing it really amp me up at first and i get super euphoric and happy for two hour and then i feel awful and anxious and depressed it actually potentiates my adhd symptom it make me extremely thirsty all the time so i keep having to leave class to go use the bathroom or fill up my water bottle adderall make it harder for me to appreciate the beauty of nature i feel le in touch with my emotion when i take it i understand that adderall help people a lot of the time so it worth a shot but it didnt help me at all in fact it probably made thing worse

1724,fluoxetine,ive been taking this pill since grade so ive been on the medication for yr now and i havent experienced any bad side effect but in my opinion it didnt fully help me recover even over a year ive taken it i would still get thought of suicide or hurting myself either if it physically or emotionally but since last summer when ive told my youth worker about whats been going over in my life and she suggested i go to my psychologist and see if hell up my dose or use a different medication or using therapy ive went from to mg and ive been doing a lot better in my college test and exam

1726,adderall,i am a year old male and wa never diagnosed with add or adhd however i have nearly every symptom and have suffered the consequence of this problem my entire life in short adderall changed my life i have never liked taking any medication but the increase in the quality of my life is worth any side effect i may incur down the road
1727,fluoxetine,very good treatment option it wa my first ssri and i wa taking it for anxiety and other stress i couldnt handle a well a some therapy and coping mechanism this medicine is great i take mg and even that is enough to get rid of anxiety however it doe make you lose your sex drive and can make you completely lose interest in any sexual activity but all in out it a good treatment
1728,adderall,ive been on adderall for six month for narcolepsy it ha given me a life back it ha helped my severe daytime sleepiness by about there are time if im really really tired that i can tell the med doesnt help but mostly it is excellent the only thing i dont like about it is the crash after the med wear off i can tell a huge difference and it is also disappointing that i have to take med to stay awake each day but overall i would say im very thankful for it

1739,xanax,xanax wa a godsend in the short term nearly immediate peace from all anxiety and panic symptom the longer i took it though the more problematic it became constantly increasing dose for effectiveness switching formulation finally addiction dependence didnt matter if it wa called this or that discontinuing xanax wa painful like week long restless climbing the wall no sleep id still call it useful in a low dose well supervised situation

1758,adderall xr,im and have been taking adderall xr mg for year now when i take it i can focus on school work and my job and actually succeed i like being able to do well in school and work but lately the side effect have seemed to intensify like crazy id always experienced the loss of appetite but now the sweating anxiety and depression are all starting to wreck havoc on my life im not sociable at all when im on this medication i feel like im more of a robot and if i get distracted for a second and start something else i will focus on that instead of getting my work done ive tried other medication in the past but none do the job like adderall

1762,fluoxetine,the last medication i wa on for depression completely numbed me out to the point where i had no emotion with this medication i am able to be happy and sad but it doesnrsquot work too well to keep away the suicidal thought i am on mg i wish this medication wa able to make me feel happier and not constantly be fighting between happy and sad
1763,xanax,xanax is so great for me because i selfinjure it give me the rational stance in my head when i feel like cutting myself it doesnt allow me the energy to get so angry at myself you just have to remember to actually take it when you feel your attack coming on and have patience for it to kick in this is the best benzodiazepine because it work the fastest ativan is good sometimes i saw trail but xanax being the fastest but klonopin last the longest
1764,xanax,xanax ha really helped me with my anxiety and it not habit forming to me it help me a lot
1765,fluoxetine,great for anxiety i find that i like life a lot more i like people more finally got off klonopan which i couldnt live without the problem is major lethargy ive tried taking it morning and night but the tiredness is still there im hoping that go away with time i have been on it for week

1767,alprazolam,i take it at night in order to sleep because of a bad insomnia side effect from a maoi but now if i miss just one night of the med i wake up with paralyzing anxiety chest tightness and heart palpitation this drug doe it job most of the time but it creates physical and psychological dependency and an am hangover i am looking to wean off of this soon once my new psychiatrist introduces other med change i see other user below saying they cut them in half my psychiatrist said that is dangerous because of the xr property that is why the xr pill are not scored i repeat regular use of this med creates dependency
1768,xanax,i have used xanax since i love it it ha saved my life so many time i cant count i have gone through different time in my life where i had to take mg a day just to survive the panic attack my attack come in cycle i have had them since year old and i am now i am so tired of them and feeling them i had a big one today a a matter of fact i am going through withdrawl of getting off of lexapro i am never without my xanax though simply carrying it around help keep off the panic attack sometimes if i hadnt had it i would have been put away or had killed myself long ago because having panic attack is no way to live
1769,prozac,i know this is a process but it suck im now taking mg of prozac and it literally doe nothing for me i started with zoloft and at least that wa an appetite suppressant both zoloft and prozac just make me tired which is the opposite of what im looking for my goal is to gain energy and be able to doanythingother than sleep
1770,fluoxetine,i started taking prozac for sad seasonal affective disorder and it worked really well for that well a few year ago my hubby left and i tried to increase to mg but the higher dose did not work well with me so went back to the mg until about month thought i wa ready to wean off first time i did not wean right and felt awful next time i weaned very slowly which wa much better unfortunately i began to have sign of depression again called my md to get a different one even though prozac had worked well before he recommended zoloft but after reading the awful side effect from reviewer i change my mind and have restarted prozac the only side effect i get with prozac is decreased sex drive mg work for me
1771,fluoxetine,the best thing that ha happened to me in a long time im only on my second month but my pmdd symptom have already reduced and the anxiety that i had throughout the rest of the month is pretty much gonei feel like myself again and cant believe how much brighter everything seems did get flu symptom at the beginning dry mouth and awful nightmare but after a couple of week they all disappeared im on mg
1773,fluoxetine,this medicine is magic i swear it ha worked wonder for me i wish i would have been put on this long before any others might i add never try paxil dont do it youll thank me later anyhow prozac ha been a total game changer for me i wa skeptical at first because of how many ppl say they suffer from sexual side effect but let me tell you there none of that here i havent had a single negative side effect from prozac i feel happy and energized work great for my severe depression and anxiety i take mg a day one of the oldest best crazy med around
1774,xanax,xanax ha really helped me relax i have severe anxiety depression and ptsd i take seroquel xr and recently my doctor switched me from xanax to atarax the atarax did not work at all i have suffered from anxiety for year and the only thing that ha been effective is xanax i would recommend this to anyone who ha moderate to severe anxiety it doe have a high addiction rate so be extremely careful when taking this
1776,adderall xr,honestly taking adderall ha help me very much i no longer fight with others and im not overly sensitive anymore ever since i have been taking it my grade have gone up just a month i went from failing everything to passing all my class for me i dont have any negative side effect except one when i drive alone at night sometimes i think i see something on my passenger floor move and it freak me out immensely but thats rare overall i my symptom leave and go
1778,fluoxetine,ive been using fluoxetine now for and a half month and it didnt work immediately the first week it definitely reduced the flash by about the next few week it gradually reduced more and more this is where i am nowhot flush about very slight i can hardly class it a a hot flush anymore ive had about night sweat in the past month my angry mood have gone and will not be persuaded to stop taking this medication it a little miracle that ha changed my life for the better yaaaaaaaayy
1779,amphetamine,i have taken adderall mg xr for a little over a year along with a mg boost needed after lunch to get my attention and motivation going since it only help a little to calm my thought down and only jump from starting task instead of and slowed my thought down a little bit the dr thought to try this new medication adzenys xr mg started it day ago and it doe nothing for me i have zero motivation to many thought are swimming around also have a constant headache for the majority of the morning and dull one later and then a crash at midday at least with adderall my motivation wa great i thought about a few thing at the same time instead of being bombarded and no crash
1781,adderall,i take the xr and it allows me to focus throughout the day at work and in class i can actually sit down and complete a task i can get something done for once and the only side effect i really experienced were a bit of dry mouth at first and some continued loss of appetite otherwise completely effective unfortunately my insurance company only cover the brand name otherwise it would be much much cheaper it the brunt of my monthly prescription cost
1782,xanax xr,i have been on mg x daily of the generic form of xanax xr for about month i still get anxiety building up in my chest here and there but have had no side effect or panic attack since i started im a little worried about getting off of it eventually though for now though it is a miracle medicine now if only i could find the same kind of medicine for my depression
1783,fluoxetine,i started taking fluoxetine in april for social anxietyocd i wa hooked on drug for year thats what caused it ive been sober for year but unfortunately my mind didnt repair itself i felt a difference with my anxiety straight away but it took week for it to really start working fully i kept thinking in that first week that i should have kept upping the dose because at time it didnt feel like it wa working but exactly week in big difference in how i wa feeling basically no anxiety at all highly recommend this medication and i had hardly any side effect i tried zoloft year ago and the side effect were terrible fluoxetine is much much better stick with it it worth it

1793,alprazolam,ive been on alprazolam for a couple year now im now on mg time a day but only take a needed it ha been a life saver for me but now my doctor ha prescribed me viibryd mg and i have been on every antidepressant you can think of and ha not been a good experience
1795,xanax,i started this medication after developing a moderateserve anxiety disorder after my grandfather passed unexpectedly i wa started on mg to to take twice a day and it had absolutely no effect on me if anything it made me anxiety symptom worse and my breathing more shallow amp panicked the only thing the medication wa good for wa to help me sleep other than that it did not clear any anxious thought or take any of the edge off my anxiety i would not recommend it for constant anxietyanxious thought ive heard it only good for killing quick burst panic attack ha no affect on long term anxious thought

1802,prozac,ive been on mg fluoxetine for just over one week i did take it for a few day a little while ago it made my ibs worse so i stopped my doctor persuaded me to give it another go i know it early day but so far it all bad before i wa tired unmotivated no concentration barely able to wash or do the simplest thing now im like the walking dead even more tired even le motivation brain fog you name it and possibly more depressed i also had terrible joint pain i have arthritis anyway the joint pain seem to be lessening the others arent so far i just hope it a case of getting worse before it get better co atm it almost unbearable
1803,adderall,my experience with adderall for one it make me poop like crazy im super thirsty dry mouth and it kill my appetite i dont eat for hour and i didnt have a desire to but while i wa at work i wa on top of everything a far proofreading catching error it doe make you focus and more alert i wa multi tasking and the fact that i didnt feel overwhelmed wa a plus
1807,fluoxetine,i have been in this medicine for month first started on mg now increasing to mg i am taking it for depression and anxiety it take about a month before i see some effect mood wa lifted and feel calmer but cant stop yawning in the beginning i did felt increased anxiety before this subsidesi will continue to take this medicine and hope to get better
1808,fluoxetine,i wa first put on wellbutrin at mg then mg but that kept me up and i really wasnt feeling much of a difference the doctor added prozac mg for the first day i could sleep after that if feel like im coming off a caffeine high a i get very tired but i never experience a high in energy i get hot flash and sweat about min after taking it but then it go away i yawn all the time another thing ive noticed since ive been on it wa decreased sexual mood and ejaculation feel weird just weird im not emotionless but sadness depression and anger seem to not be present decreased appetite and lost a little weight no other side effect experience
1810,alprazolam,i have been taking alprazolam for about year i started with mg daily a needed but my anxiety panic attack and depression got worse my doctor increased to mg twice a day it worked for a short period of time now i feel so terrible than i take mg time a day sometimes mg a day anxiety still present with panick attack the doctor added lexapro mg daily i could divide mg am and mg pm i have moment of tranquility but they are short i tried meditation soft music make more depressed i have no family member and basically no friend no energy or desire to do thing i used to like i stay at home most of the time affraid of drive i dont have money to see a counselor only every month to psychiatrist
1811,fluoxetine,i have taken prozacflouxetine off and on for a few year to treat bulimia it truly allows you to lead a normal life again without your day being consumed by thought of food and bingingpurging i have always been my physically healthiest when i wa taking my mg daily i would however wean myself off eventually due to the sexual dysfunction and a lack of feeling emotion a well a feeling like i had beaten the bulima only to have it return fullfledged within month that is the case now so im going back on it it is still important to get cognitive therapy so that you may control it on your own if prozac effect eventually wear off for you dont use it a a bandaid for the problem
1812,fluoxetine,i have suffered bulimia for about year and at different stage wa bingingpurging up to time a day over the year i have tried so many medication but prozac is the first to really assist i started on mg which ha recently increased to mg this is the only medicinetherapy that ha dramatically decreased my impulse to bingepurge i am feeling so happy within myself and it ha really assisted with my depression and low energy level too one odd side effect i have noted is that i am yawning a lot a small price to pay to being in control of my eating and mood this is definitely worth a try if you are having bulimic symptom and recommend it highly good luck
1813,adderall xr,ughh im so depressed reading the positive review im a bit envious i guess but i take the adderal xr for adhd and it would work for me for only an hour and thats it after that i would be a zombie so tired no motivation bed ridden to be honest im devastated it work for so many people i had such high hope back to the scratch board again i didnt want to believe it wa the medicine because of all the positivity but it definitely is quite depressed

1820,fluoxetine,i have been on this medication for around year mg a day for ocd and depression it got me out of a very very deep hole got me back to work able to function got me back a a normal person u fortuantly i used alcohol and recreational drug aswell which made me riddled with anxiety and depression im clean and sober year now and am still on the prozac iv recently had a low episode and i wa self medicating with my prozac a and when i needed obviously this wasnt the greatest idea and this ha led me back to being depressed again but im back on mg of prozac a day i may feel like i have gone back to the begining of it all but i havent iv just had a little set back in my recovery all in all prozac for me is a life saver
1825,fluoxetine,young male early s i suffer from major depression a well a anxiety i tried mg prozac only because it supposedly give people more energy the first week i experienced side effect such a extreme fatigue and increased anxiety after week i began to feel better however it worked until it seemed to stop after about a month it still helped relieve my symptom slightly but i had returning feeling of fear panic negativity etc and never felt more energized i stopped taking it and after day immediately felt much better i ended up switching back to mg lexapro because it worked great for me prozac helped somewhat but for those who struggle mostly with depressionanxiety id try more selective ssri personally
1827,alprazolam,in i started feeling like i wa having a heart attack twice a month i ended up in the er amp wa admitted i happen to be one of the lucky female who suffers from hormonal anxiety i wa given all the test possible stayed overnight amp discharged with my first script of the smallest dose of xanax i have used it only a needed since then and to this day it still help me at the smallest dose once a day i have gone through some very serious rough patch in my life which had me taking this at most pill maybe four day in a row it work so well that i cant ever imagine taking it more often than needed why would you want to mess up something that work the key is taking it a prescribed just like any medication
1828,xanax,i think xanax work great taking it along with an antidepressant right now i am currently taking mg of xanaz along with mg of celexa i believe it ha helped me out it so many way i used to have anxiety and panic attack pretty much all day or part of the day that i wa awake i havent felt this good about myself in a long time sometimes i would get a panic attack just from walking in a public place such a a supermarket and then came the heavy breathing and the nervous feeling out of nowhere but the xanax put all the feeling to rest i know it a narcotic and it can be abused and it also can cause dependency but if used the right way i know it can work for some of the worst condition of depression
1830,prozac,i wa prescribed mg of this medication for the first month and felt okay but i still had my bad day on my th week my doc upped my prescription to mg and in the week i wa on that dosage my anxiety wa through the roof i went back to my doctor with my symptom and he put me back down to mg with the intent of weening me off of it plus this make you kind of emotionless like a zombie even on my good day where i wasnt anxious i just didnt have the motivation to do anything i really dont recommend this to anyone but if it help you thats good
1831,fluoxetine,i started with a very low dose to treat depression mg i also had become quite the alcoholic binge drinking right down to the last drop had no motivation and lot of self pity prozac helped me recover my lost personality gave me hope and curbed the drinking to full time sobriety i take mg a day i would suggest that folk give it two month before giving up im glad i did nine month of no drinking and i work full time
1833,fluoxetine,i started on mg and increased to mg for anxiety and depression i can not praise this drug enough for how calm it make me feel i feel like i can handle any problem big or small with a clear head thank you prozac for giving my life back to me

1835,fluoxetine,started on fluoxetine about a year ago after starting to experience panic attack for the first time in my life after a major life change have dealt with social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder without any treatment for year along with cbt fluoxetine ha given me my life back truly for a while i never thought i would be okay again or be able to get back to feeling normal i convinced myself that i wa having heart attack and stroke at year old because of the panic symptom and i ended up at urgent care several time because of this this medication is truly the best and i give it so much credit for getting my life back
1836,xanax xr,i wa prescribed regular xanax in the early s for anxiety and it changed my life for the better i wa more productive than ever my relationship got back to where they should be and i wa finally sleeping well a time went on my tolerance increased and i suffered significant peak and valley between dos throughout the day xanax xr wa complete game changer for me a completely different medication i take it in the morning and feel great all day long and i sleep well i still take the regular xanax on occasion if my anxiety flare the xr version is far better but much more expensive the mo is nothing when it come to quality of life
1838,alprazolam,ive suffered from generalized anxiety for year at one point i could barely leave my house afraid to drive on bridge tunnel fly i even had anxiety about taking taking anxiety medication xanax wa a game changer for me i rarely take it but ive taken trip i never thought i would be able to take get this i wa even able to skydive not bad for an agoraphobic it build confidence just having it in my pocket really help i had to take a mg dose tonight because ive been in panic mode for five day and i finally needed to reset my mental state i think david burn quotfeeling good handbookquot is an awesome tool too im rambling because after day of super anxiety i finally took a and now i feel great
1839,fluoxetine,i started taking mg prozac last tuesday so it been a week and a half and the first few day i wa tired but i seem to be doing thing here and there that id put off for a while and thing i dont normally feel like doing that is encouraging and make me think it working ive had a lot of loss in my life in the last year and also going through menopause which is adding to my depression and general bad feeling my husband also gambled away my inheritance from my mom and my kid college money that his dad left for them i just cant believe he did that and it something i struggle with every day since were not super financially stable i hope this medicine continues to work better every day ive been told it take week

1856,xanax,xanax is a lifesaver for me i am year old diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia post traumatic stress disorder generalized anxiety disorder obsessive compulsive disorder and depression it all started when i wa about or year old to make a long story short every other medicine i took either didnt work or made me gain a ton of weight ssri i am currently weaning myself off of zoloft from mg since it doesnt seem to be working any more down to mg at the moment i plan on just taking xanax alone when im off of the zoloft it is the only medicine that relief all of my symptom i will see my doc tomorrow to discus what dosage i should take after going off of zoloft completely because i do take both right now im just tired of being fat from all these ssri
1857,alprazolam,this treatment completely stopped my panic attack which i thought could never be controlled just take when you get up to guarantee a peaceful day i tried all the antidepressant from depakote to lithium they all had some weird side effect
1859,fluoxetine,my psychiatrist prescribed me prozac recently when he diagnosed me with generalised anxiety disorder and depression my depression and anxiety wa really bad i constantly worried about the same thing over and over again and couldnt control it got bad panic attack could not eat or sleep and became very depressed xanax helped me but only temporarily im taking prozac mg nearly two week now and already i feel like im getting back to myself i no longer worry im eating and sleeping better and panic attack are just a thing of the past the only side effect i have are increased appetite and fatigue but all i can say is that prozac is a god send that i would highly recommend it it ha helped me so much
1860,alprazolam,i developed tinnitus and it ha been driving me nut for a year i reduced my dosage of alprazolam this past week to the point that i have not had any of this medication for several day now guess what no tinnitus it is completely gone my alprazolam prescription is mg if i find myself needing a dose because of anxiety i will take one half of a pill and it should get rid of my anxiety i wanted other people to know the use of alprazolam can cause tinnitus
1861,adderall,i wa when i wa diagnosed with adhd started adderall i take mg of sr a day and the difference is phenomenal i get up with ease because i know i can tackle all task with astounding motivation and actually enjoy doing tedious work i am comorbid with anxiety rumination and i wa highly neurotic i found myself aggressive quick tempered and easily abusing marijuana and alcohol this all changed with adderall i am rational reflect on situation in a positive light and generally just a more helpful and kind person adderall completely saved my professional and personal life side note it can cause erectile dysfunction but it will go away after your body is used to the cycle
1862,adderall,add is not a made up condition im without adderallvyvanse i have no mental energy or focus to do anything and it ha been this way my entire life school ha gone from being an f and d student to being an a and b student it ha nothing to do with quotbeing lazyquot and everything to do with having a real chemical imbalance in the brain anyways have been full time for year until week ago i convinced myself it wasnt working anymore and i didnt need it big mistake i am ready to start up again next week i can feel the old me come back the me i hated if you truly have addadhd this will change your life for the better some negative are sleeping le decreased apatite and often weak erection on it despite high libido
1863,fluoxetine,i took prozac for several year to treat my depression and it wa awesome it had few side effect but gave me my life back i went from not leaving my bed to actually being a productive member of society again i did lose a good deal of weight while i wa on it but that eventually balanced out i took it until it got to the point where it stopped working for me and ive never found anything that ha worked a well hopefully i will be able to take it and have it work for me again one day
1866,fluoxetine,if you scroll down a bit to you will find my rave review of prozac for ocd and more than people found it useful a well which is great now it a year and a half later and i went from lb i never struggled with weight to lb today and im just quot my diet did not change in fact i battled anorexia in my teen i just dont enjoy food that much and still dont i truly believe some people may eat more but ultimately it mess with your thyroid and hormone bad so this is what ill say prozac is pure genius and doe work very very well you will probably lose weight in the first few month and then a you approach a year the weight come on fast and hard
1867,prozac,i started prozac a year ago for severe anxiety and depression i now feel like a whole different person only thing im wondering is if i gained weight from it i am now lb heavier than last year but i started a different birth control at the same time so that could be it a well
1868,prozac,most of my life i have struggled with severe panic attack general anxiety ptsd amp moderate depression been on med twice before until i felt better amp then i would stop taking them this last time it had been close to a year that i had been suffering again before i decided to reluctantly go back on med i tried celexa again it worked kinda okay in the past but this time it made no improvement for me saw the doc who switched me to prozac all i can say is wow best yet i feel like my old happy self after only month mg the first week the second and mg the last two give it time to work amp be patient it might make you feel a bit off amp not better at first but it is a miracle drug these bad feeling will pas hang in there
1870,alprazolam,this ha been a god send for me it make me feel like im on a more even playing field and ive had le panic attack with only having to take every hour that is also helpful a i am on other medicine for depression and fibromyalgia i would recommend for anyone with anxiety andor panic disorder to definitely try this if you can get your doctor to prescribe it for you a it is becoming harder and harder to get the medicine that actually work for u because they think we will all become addicted i always say give u the medicine we need for our problem that work and well worry about the rest later
1871,xanax,my doctor prescribed mg which i take half a tablet going to bed if that doesnt work i take the other half depends on how much sleep i need or how much anxiety i have if im exhausted the medicine is great i fall asleep and next thing i know im awake in the morning but it usually leaf a hangover which i hate i try to deal with my anxiety holisticly but sometimes that doe not work i think it all come down to eating healthy and watching my sugar and carb and caffeine intake walking and doing stretch work for me but honestly having someone who really love you and doe not abuse you in anyway is the best answer but i dont think there many people out there like that anymore koliopin is a horrible dangerous drug all pharmaceutical a far a im concerned are bad for u and then least we take it the better off we are
1872,prozac,i am a year old woman who seemed to be depressed all the time i wa always depressed and cry now i never get depressed and seldom do i cry and thing that bothered me they dont affect me much now this ha been a godsend for me
1873,fluoxetine,in i wa miserable for no particular reason and wa diagnosed with depression and prescribed prozac great life depression in check in i weened myself off it because i didnt think i needed it anymore a luck would have it i hit a period of challenging event in life that they brain interpreted a trauma to cope i began drinking a little which evolved into daily i concluded that i had gone off prozac decreased self control and created a personal crisis im back on prozac and my mood have leveled off and i so far have the ability to abstain i wont go off it again
1874,adderall,ive been using adderall for a few month i have extreme depression along with add i wa taking zoloft before and wa scared that the adderall might counteract with my zoloft and make ma a zombie or suicidal well the first few day of taking adderall i wa light headed weak and didnt eat after a few day of throwing up i finally took to the drug my grade are going up in school im losing weight this drug really is turning my life around the main reason i wa on it wa to concentrate and get my grade up adderall allows me to bring my grade up
1875,alprazolam,really doe help with anxietypanic attack but ha nasty withdrawal i wa prescribed mg x a day and whenever i moved my new doctor stopped prescribing me them pretty much forcing me to quit cold turkey worst month of my life and it only exacerbated my anxiety in the end
1876,xanax,in i started feeling like i wa having a heart attack twice a month i ended up in the er amp wa admitted i happen to be one of the lucky female who suffers from hormonal anxiety i wa given all the test possible stayed overnight amp discharged with my first script of the smallest dose of xanax i have used it only a needed since then and to this day it still help me at the smallest dose once a day i have gone through some very serious rough patch in my life which had me taking this at most pill maybe four day in a row it work so well that i cant ever imagine taking it more often than needed why would you want to mess up something that work the key is taking it a prescribed just like any medication
1877,fluoxetine,this medicine wa actually doing some good my doctor started me off at mg since i dont respond well to antidepressant such a paxil effexor at first i started actually having the suicidal thought they warned me about for the first week eventually after week i started to notice a difference in my panic attack they were weaker but still bothersome my depression wa also getting better but around month of taking it i still had the cry spell i told my doctor and he bumped me up to mg slowly i really started to notice a bigger improvement it been almost month and my panic attack are very weak a i am able to control them my cry spell arent a bad but i still get them not a often which is great
1878,prozac,the last medication i wa on for depression completely numbed me out to the point where i had no emotion with this medication i am able to be happy and sad but it doesnrsquot work too well to keep away the suicidal thought i am on mg i wish this medication wa able to make me feel happier and not constantly be fighting between happy and sad
1879,fluoxetine,i have been on many anti depressant and by farprozac gave me my life back i am bi polar with ptsd and anxiety i did lose weight and that wa okay i can sleep and am a happy woman again i take mg each morning i do not need a benzo for anxiety any longer oh and i am year old after fifteen year of zoloft lexapro paxil effexor wellbutrin you name it ive been on it for long period changed to prozac month ago i have my life back
1880,fluoxetine,prozac is my miracle medicine i have been on different antidepressant over the year and prozac is the only one that ever helped me feel quotnormalquot with no side effect it is wonderful it hard to find an ssri that cause no side effect for me prozac ha been the only one and i just love it my quality of life is much better now and i can function in a happy state of mind wonderful
1881,xanax,powerful and fast relief from panic attack ive had to carefully balance benzodiazepine because the higher the dose the more likely ill suffer withdrawal related rebound effect right now im at mg x a needed ive been a high a mg le is more still ive not found anything a effective a an alternative xanax just work and fast
1882,xanax,i dont have panic or depression problem i have sleeping problem i fall asleep fine but wake up around am and can not go back to sleep because my mind is too active thinking about stupid stuff like movie lawn mower hunting visiting my grandkids working on my car music planned project football you name it i take xanax when i wake up earky and cant sleep xanax make me go back to sleep almost immediately and i wake up around am feeling great i have not noted any side effect but i take it only when needed

1887,alprazolam,xanax help improve my mood but only when im really anxious otherwise it doe nothing for my mood and actually cause my psychomotor retardation to become worse if your depression is heavily influenced by your anxiety this drug will probably work well for you otherwise unless your depression cause significant agitation id suggest staying away from this drug

1986,adderall,for me adderall ha changed my life remarkably for the good without adderall i wouldnt be able to work hour a week like i do a well a going to school fulltime yes it may be a amphetamine and produce similar euphoric high to meth and mdma however it is far different a far a when it is broken down chemically for those who have little knowledge in chemistry just one small change in the chemical structure to a drug that may seem so insignificant can actually change the drug dramatically when it come to the side effect adderall is a very useful drug and provides many benefit with much le side effect then the other not so good drug in it class
1987,prozac,i am going through menopause i have been cry most day for about a year i have constant obsessive negative thought about myself i went to the doctor to request hrt she talked me into prozac i wa diagnosed with low depression mid range anxiety and high stress i have only been taking this for day but already my life ha changed the tear have stopped i am no longer obsessing about thing that might or might not happen my confidence is back i am reaching out more socially and feel once again that life is good i do however eat well and exercise regularly i dont think any thing can counteract a poor diet and no exercise hot flash have also almost disappeared so far no side effect
1988,prozac,wa on mg for yr not much change switched to mg for two week then doctor bumped it up to mgday i think it might help depression but i feel it doing very little to help anxiety dont like the idea of having to be dependent on medicine to make me feel normal stick with it awhile longer
1989,prozac,young male early s i suffer from major depression a well a anxiety i tried mg prozac only because it supposedly give people more energy the first week i experienced side effect such a extreme fatigue and increased anxiety after week i began to feel better however it worked until it seemed to stop after about a month it still helped relieve my symptom slightly but i had returning feeling of fear panic negativity etc and never felt more energized i stopped taking it and after day immediately felt much better i ended up switching back to mg lexapro because it worked great for me prozac helped somewhat but for those who struggle mostly with depressionanxiety id try more selective ssri personally
1990,xanax,i wa switched onto this drug after taking lorazepam ativan which i wa very happy with and had almost no side effect with i started taking it combined with effexor and it wa horrible i would take it pas out for an hour and wake up feeling the same a before i could see how it would be good for a panic attack but for general anxiety it is not very good if you are on a constant dose you will be taking them about to time a day which is too much to keep up with i also found much more intense effect from this drug which i consider dangerous because i dont want to get addicted to them i think the drug is good for anxiety attack but for general anxiety i would ask for lorazepam or klonopin
1991,alprazolam,taking a mg bar when i feel anxiety coming on help tremendously only negative effect is that i completely blackout and cant remember what i did or what happened
1992,fluoxetine,one of the worst medication ever cause nightmare and make u depressed and panicky

2056,alprazolam,it been month now off xanax wa taking up to mg a day for year after brother killed himself and im just now starting to feel like myself again coming off the xanax wa the hardest thing ive ever done i had to force myself to work and keep my job i had good day and bad day more bad than good my symptom were crazy no sleep headache shake twitching pain everywhere memory problem if i knew how hard it is to come off benzos i never would have touched it short term use ok stressful eventok if this help one person then yay please be careful dont end up detoxing off of a benzo and going thru hell for week or month research this med not fun
2057,fluoxetine,prozac absolutely changed my life not only did it get rid of my daily anxiety and is slowly but surely getting rid of my social anxiety but it also made me generally a happier person by far the best anxiety medicine ive tried
2058,prozac,what a life saver and i mean that in the very literal sense ive now been taking mg of prozac for about day the fist week wa hell i couldnt sleep i felt more depressed anxious and panicky than before nauseous and disorientated but stuck with it only now that im starting to feel better do i start to realize how incredibly unwell and out of control ive been for so long im now starting to feel like i have my brain back and am in possession of rational thought again

2061,fluoxetine,i wa on lexapro which made me suicidal and started prozac mg it wa easy to wean off the lexapro after taking my pill in the morning i immediately felt severe drowsiness heavy eyelid and tiredness i started during my holiday and took a nap every afternoon but once back to work the tiredness wa unbearable especially in the afternoon i could hardly keep my eye open and have never drank so much espresso and energy drink the espresso did not even bring me to shaking whatsoever nor relieved my drowsiness after week and day i quit but side effect lasted for at least a week i must say it lifted my depression
2062,alprazolam,very helpful in reducing anxiety for me it is fastacting and it made a difference in me being able to keep up with my job now im on klonopin though since the doctor said that it stay in the system longer for anxiety however the fast relief of xanax work very well when an immediate spike in anxiety happens the effect usually only last a few hour for me and i can understand how it can be addictive for this reason but it been great for immediate panic symptom and helpful with focusing i did not notice that quotdrugged upquot foggy feeling on a small dose of mg mg a needed
2063,alprazolam,my wife us xanax she is bipolar ii she ha a lot of depression and anxiety but not much hypomania she take two mg when she is having a really bad day which is about every other day it knock her out for about four hour often time she will wake up and then about hour later she need to take another xanex it help in emergency but doe nothing for the underlying cause of her severe depression and anxiety im glad it there for emergency though i wish it did something to decrease the frequency of emergency

2070,fluoxetine,i have been on these now for around month they really are impressive i wa previously on citalopram and sertraline but didnt find these to be any help so these were next in my thought to try i have suffered from anxiety bdd panic ocd overactive thought and depressive mood for some time now and i wa recommended to go on these because i wa feeling so low always i also experienced high amount of anger outburst from the issue which have now been cut down greatly thanks to these tablet taking these ha also improved my relationship although i am far from being mentally well i am happy to say that i am now more stable and hopefully more able to manage the problem better than before mg

2074,prozac,having a history of family heath problem it wa my time to develop one of my own i wa diagnosed with moderately severe depression and wa placed on a moderate dose of prozac week in i became extremely lethargic my mood hadnt stabilized one bit i presumed i would need a higher dose and that followed eventually the dosage had quadrupled and showing no improvement i beg to view the world in a haze nothing seemed real and i didnt recognize myself i wa incredibly suicidal if you are not feeling this drug is effective do not continue using it otherwise suicide is a very genuine threat i have found sertraline effective a opposed to this freakish medicine
2075,alprazolam,xanax work almost immediately when im having a panic attack i have tried a lot of different quotnewerquot antidepressant and they always have weird side effect then the doctor say to keep taking them for week to work
2076,fluoxetine,sarafem should be in the water have suffered from depression my whole life never knew how bad it wa until i started to take sarafem started at mg i am at mg today have tried to decrease dose or come off completely usually blaming weight gain amp tiredness on it but it wa not worth it very little weight gain and my tiredness never went away i have been on sarafem for over year if anything it saved my marriage take each night before bed amp have the script written for the brand namethere is a difference

2139,xanax,truly a miracle pill starting have severe anxiety attack out of nowhere heart palpation numbness in arm and leg dizzy tremor and with to min i feel normal again i would advise to only take when desperately need to because i can see how they can become addictive i take mg but will start to cut that in half a lower dosage is always better if it work i have only been taking for one week so far so good and no side effect to report
2143,prozac,i have been struggling with major depression for six month and finally when i went to the doctor i wa prescribed with mg of prozac the first five day were horrible and the worst have i ever felt after that i begun feeling good again i begun having weird dream however and sometimes lack the ability to feel certain feeling at the end i really do believe this medication ha saved me
2144,alprazolam,about a year ago i wa diagnosed with severe anxiety with panic attack anxiety run in my family so for me it wa not a huge shock for me to have anxiety i have tried about three different medication that just made me feel awful i did not feel like myself and i wa always sleepy once i got put on xanax with another type of anxiety medication it helped subside my panic attack anytime i would have a panic attack i would take a xanax and it would help me be able to fell like myself again i do not take xanax every day just because i do not have panic attack everyday and because it is highly addicted for me this medication worked
2145,adderall xr,have been taking adderall xr for over a year now i am having some issue with tolerance now but it still working reasonably well had side effect for the first few month but now i have none good stuff
2146,alprazolam,i always suffered from major test anxiety during high school and college when i returned to school to get my master i knew that the level of anxiety i would get before an exam couldnt be healthly i wa getting panic attack finally i felt comfortable enough to ask the doctor for help i only have major anxiety before an exam and this medication really help me i do not use it every day only when my anxiety is peaking great for moderate use
2147,alprazolam,i started xanax yr ago after taking klonopin for year my life changed for the better instantly before xanax i wa trapped in my own mind constantly worrying instead of enjoying my family it ha now become a curse for year been on mg daily and i have severe panic attack depression and insomnia mg of trazodone for insomnia is not helping so i use my xanax to sleep then i run out early leading to detox im just going in circle discussed with my family about going to a detox center and starting over with other med
2148,prozac,i love prozac i have major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder i wa on lexapro for half a year and despite not being a teen or young adult i had my first ever suicidal thought on the lexapro i felt sedated i gained weight and i wa still depressed it did help with anxiety but instead i wa often nauseated now after week of prozac world of difference im smiling motivated looking forward to the near and distant future i still have some mild nausea and it not a good with the anxiety or insomnia still it great for me because im motivated and energetic enough throughout the day to make myself tired enough to sleep and im better at dealing with stressful thing
2150,xanax xr,still use a regular xanax at time when thing get bad but the xr is amazing for those time where i cant afford the drowsiness xr is just a nice steady dose to take the edge off and no side effect would recommend
2151,prozac,i took lexapro for a little over a year and it worked beautifully the only reason i weaned off wa because of weight gain my doctor prescribed mg of prozac and said it should not cause any weight gain i am on it day now and my only side effect is slight anxiety and a few panic attack i had none of this on lexapro my question is should i hand in there and when will i feel good
2152,prozac,i had been having anxiety and other symptom such a weight loss i wa diagnosed with ocd and started on mg prozac i battled with side effect for the first month of increased anxiety nauseousness and sleeping problem at about the week mark the negative side effect went away and i started to feel some relief from the anxiety caused by the ocd i wa increased to mg which seems to be enough for me i have now been on it for over a year i feel so much better like a weight is lifted off of my shoulder and i no longer worry and ob i have gained some weight but the anxiety had made me lose weight so i think i am able to eat now because i feel better i dont sweat the small stuff in life anymore
2153,prozac,prozac is not for everyone i wa prescribed mg for my anxiety i felt awesome for about two day on this medicine then the insomnia mood swing and rage set in it helped my anxiety but the effect on my mood were absolutely intolerable i started feeling dizzy and my eye hurt like i wa staring in the sun too long i think it totally flooded my brain with serotonin and it wa like system overload this is way too strong of a medication for someone with moderate anxiety and not much depression for someone who is severely depressed it might helpit definitely boost energy
2154,fluoxetine,it great i get song in my head or find myself humming and that hasnt happened for a long time more random positive thought too and much le of the bad one i sometimes feel down but it not often and i think unavoidable the side affect i notice is phase of vivid bad dream more nightmare and more stand that are stressful and occupy my mind too much which make me feel le rested
2155,fluoxetine,i wa put on prozac year ago to help with severe premenapausal symtoms ie anxiety night sweat hot flash depression lack of concentration i wa amazed how good it felt and how much it helped with all these symptom the extra bonus wa i wa much happier relaxed and more social than i had been ever before the serotonin wa a miracle drug i take mg time a day and if i miss more than day all my symtoms a well a depression kick in im and it been a life savor for me
2156,fluoxetine,very cheap cure for depression saved my life had no side effect i think this should be the first antidepressant to try when your diagnosed i wa a teen and it is safe
2157,prozac,the pill work but it make me dizzy and so sleepy
2158,xanax,i have suffered severe depression for year and wa finally coming out of it with a cocktail of lithium luvox and epilim when the anxiety kicked in my doctor prescribed xanax which worked but the come down wa the worst i have ever had just a personal experience on mixing drug i guess

2160,adderall xr,adderall xr ha changed my life for year i have struggled with depression and just not feeling well i happened across an article on adult add and recognized the symptom i talked to my doctor and went off effexor xr and then began taking adderall xr before i ha lost focus by and didnt even know where to begin on project for work everything just seemed to be too difficult to do i couldnt make it through the day without a long nap i feel great am actually enjoying my work and dont need nap anymore always take it first thing in the morning otherwise it will interfere with sleep
2161,fluoxetine,prozac is not for everyone i wa prescribed mg for my anxiety i felt awesome for about two day on this medicine then the insomnia mood swing and rage set in it helped my anxiety but the effect on my mood were absolutely intolerable i started feeling dizzy and my eye hurt like i wa staring in the sun too long i think it totally flooded my brain with serotonin and it wa like system overload this is way too strong of a medication for someone with moderate anxiety and not much depression for someone who is severely depressed it might helpit definitely boost energy
2163,xanax,i started having panic attack about year ago the dr gave me a few different drug to try all either had horrible side effect including nightmare or did nothing then we tried xanax it wa a miracle for me one mg xanax and i can function again when i wa promoted at work to a position where i would have to speak in front of a crowd i wa terrified but taking one of these ha changed my life
2164,adderall,adderall ha been hugely beneficial in allowing me to function with improved mental acuity and i am able to take a relatively low dose to achieve these desired treatment effect
2165,prozac,fluoxetine is pretty gentle compared to most other antidepressant medicine i had a good response from zoloft almost year ago and when i had breakthrough depression i wa switched to effexor effexor worked but wa prohibitively expensive then i wa finally stated on prozacfluoxetine i had zero side effect during the first weekwhich wa vastly different from my experience with the other twoand at mgday fluoxetine seems just a efficacious fluoxetine ha worked well for my panic depression and general anxiety one must give it time to work for people that are really struggling six week can seem a lifetime but for many that is how long it take for fluoxetine to work
2166,prozac,prozac is great when you first start you can feel a little anxious but hang in there it ha changed my whole outlook on life after being really depressed after a divorce and trying to raise two kid on my own it gave me the confidence to get a job and enjoy working again before it i had little confidence i love laughing again which i do a lot now no side effect for me except feeling a bit weird and anxious for the first few week
2167,prozac,this medicine ha been a life saver for me it is the only antidepressant that ha worked i lost weight on it which i needed to feel le stressed can handle stress thought are not obsessive anymore i laugh more and interact more with friend i dont feel scared everyday if you are thinking of taking it give it at least week to kick it it worth it
2168,fluoxetine,i have had general anxiety for a long a i can remember and it started really interfering with my daily life and relationship my doctor put me on prozac with mg dosage the first week i did have a bit of nausea so it wa hard eating in the morning but thats the only side effect i noticed it helped me get rid of anxious thought that had once wrecked my life and made me calm without ridding me of my outgoing and bubbly personality that made me really happy however i have now been on it for almost month and i am noticing a large decrease in sex drive it ha started effecting my relationship so im currently looking at other option other than that i would recommend
2169,prozac,only been a week on mg and i already feel can not wait for the future week and to be thank you god for prozac
2170,prozac,pro great at controlling depression anxiety and stress con feel agitated hyper and impulsive on it some daytime fatigue longer to orgasm and decreased sex drive sexual dysfunction make me feel le attractive and confident around my man vivid dream at night numbed emotion must have patience when getting off to avoid withdrawal symptom my taper wa two month long note i would rather have a lowered sex drive than anxiety stress or depression though
2172,sarafem,my obgyn gave me this for premenstrual dysphoric disorder and it took me a while to actually take it because of the stigma that go along with taking prozac i wish i had taken it sooner a it ha made such a difference i have more patience i donut get angry a much and am happier than i have ever been i originally wa prescribed it for day a month week before my period but it ha been so helpful that i am taking it every day i take mg in the morning the first couple of week i had a hard time sleeping i would wake up in the middle of the night and couldnut fall back to sleep that went away and i have no other side effect i know so many people who should be taking this someone mentioned that it should be in the water and i agree
2173,prozac,my doctor switched me from cymbalta to prozac after the cymbalta didnt seem to be working for me any longer i started out taking mg per day now i am taking mg per day i had been taking the prozac at night before going to bed but noticed i wa having a lot more trouble getting to sleep after reading the dosing information i realized that i needed to be taking this medication in the morning so i will start that in the morning by holding off my dose tonight for the time that ive been taking this medication i have not had depressive episode that i wa unable to handle and taking the depression test it wa not a high a it had been in the past so for now i will continue this med but just change to taking it in the morn

2208,alprazolam,honestly xanax pretty much saved my life i know some people have bad reaction to it but that is few and far between the rest of you that had problem clearly didnt read up on it which you should always do with your medication all i can really say is that i went from having like panic attack a week to one every six month or so when i take this medicine a needed i function so much better a a human being and am forever grateful that i got out on the right med
2209,alprazolam,i deal with an aniexty disorder where i fear anything that ha anything to do with the apocalypse or other thing like bad thing in the news or conspiracy theory when i first tried xanax it blew my mind before it i wouldnt eat or sleep because i wa so worried now i take it when i need to and it make me focus on thing at hand
2211,fluoxetine,marvellous restored my dignity anxiety management and sleep

2215,fluoxetine,after taking prozac successfully for about year i talked with my doctor about switching to a different antidepressant because i missed having a sexdrive after a year on citalopram there wa no change so i switched to bupropion it caused me to feel very depressed and extremely anxious i am well aware that antidepressant take several week to have positive effect and that the side effect also tend to go away so i stuck with the bupropion for week it just got worse and worse and i started to feel suicidal for the first time in my life i have been back on prozac now for week and am feeling a little better stopping prozac just to try to get sex drive back wa a big mistake
2216,fluoxetine,i suffered panic attack and anxiety most of my life but started having several a day after a move and job change i tried zoloft mg first and had extreme jitteriness nausea and shaking sertraline reaction my doctor switched me to a low dose of prozac to start with mghalf a mg tablet after week he moved me to mg but i had nausea and shakiness he said to go back to mg i had to continue xanax a needed for my first month the attack slowly became le severe then disappeared month now since an attack and i only take mg this ha changed my life
2217,adderall xr,my son wa diagnosed with adhd when he wa he is now we have tried changing his diet herbal remedy vyvanse strattera and several others the thing that ha worked without causing headache is the adderall rx he doe have a loss of appetite but his behavior and ability to concentrate are definitely worth it
2218,fluoxetine,im and premenopausal for a few day each month around ovulation id go from my normal self to an quoteeyorequot statethe smallest thing could set me off into an increasingly downward spiral of depression when i finally told my amazing doctor about this he explained that if it wa truly pmdd and menopausal related a very very small dose of prozac for just a few day per month would help the problem tremendously if it wa actual depression it would not work so well or so quickly he wa absolutely right i am only using mg which is a dose so small that i have to get a mg pill and break it in half i take it for approx day it critical that i take it at the very first sign of that depression before it is able to take root
2219,prozac,i wa depressed since i could remember always low energy and just wanting something to kill me didnt matter but prozac help me a lot i still have my bad day but they arent a severe of frequent thanks prozac
2220,alprazolam,this is a qualified positive review for xanax i wa suffering from mild depression and anxiety last winter and my doctor put me on wellbutrin that stuff take week to work and in the interim it can really up your anxiety level a week later i started mg xanax xday and it took care of the anxiety immediately i continued using xanax for more restful sleep but after about month i realized that short and long term memory wa way down stopped xanax and replaced with gaba and this seems to be a far better solution the wellbutrin worked great felt more energy the first week but did take week to fully kick in i will now only take the xanax for rare severe stress also check the connection to alzheimers
2221,xanax,i take quotxanaxquot prescribed by my doctor not everyday though sometimes for helping me sleep when my thought are going crazy and my imagination is wild it doe help for sleep addictive if you take it everyday
2222,xanax,only med that ha ever really worked for me ive tried every holistic approach to treat my anxiety taking a take the edge off like nothing else im afraid to take med but taking xanax doesnt make me nervous i only take it when my anxiety and panic come back sometimes i have it under control for long period of time i read a lot of negative thing about becoming addicted and the withdrawal effect but most of u who really suffer hate taking med we rather get better with no drug it help me calm down so i can think clearly and get through the day or night wanted to post something positive for those who are afraid to take it
2223,fluoxetine,im taking mg prozac since week i only relapsed twice in the first week while being on a lower dose it took away the urge to binge and even purge im le depressed too ive been through year of psychoanalysis and hospital stay all to no avail never took medicine i have bulimia for over year and am hopeful to get rid of the food pressure for good prozaz changed my life so far ill update at a later time
2225,fluoxetine,i had really bad anxiety issue before i hopped on this medicine wa constantly feeling down and never wanted to be around people the being around people part hasnt changed probably because im just a solo person but my mood is so much better and i just feel happier with life at time i feel a little to happy that i get aggravated if that make any sense but i love the medicine
2226,fluoxetine,did not have the best experience with this medication but antidepressant and anxiety medication react differently for each person for the month that i wa on prozac it improved my anxiety but every time my dosage wa changed my depression got much worse and fluctuated greatly it got so bad that i had to switch medication again every medication reacts differently for everyone
2227,prozac,i wa prescribed prozac generic mg week ago by my doctor i had a rough patch with a family member which led to extreme anxietyocd i had panic attack and left work on several ocassions this led to depression felt like surrounded by a dark cloud i am male in my late s and never suffered with this before so it really scared me i thought i wa going crazy finally decided to get help after month i wa very nervous to take after some been week and i feel so much better is seemed like day i woke up and the depression and anxiety just faded i had some side effect for first daysmental fogginess drowsiness headache waking up early but all went away hope this help and stick with it exercise help too

2230,alprazolam,i have been on xanax for about ten year and now it is ha had to come to a screeching hault at first mg three time a day wa great ii could work go into social setting and even to store it gradually got up to mg time a day for about year then came the beginning of the end i had began using more and more of this wonder drug and i ran out horrible withdrawal symptom beginning with night sweat not sleeping confusion and finally seizure not to mention the mental twist and game my mind played on me now i am on klonopin and it taken the edge off today i dont get the wonder drug feeling and im not having seizure we will see careful with use of this medicine
2231,fluoxetine,so i wa previously on citalopram and it reduced my depression but made my pmdd more noticable a psychiatrist recommended prozac a citalopram is not effective for pmdd the month that they weaned me off citalopram and onto prozac wa hell now im fully taking prozac at mg it is working already i have more energy and can get up and do thing more often ive not had a period on my full dose of prozac yet so im not sure how it will work then but from what i feel now i think it will be great side effect i have incredibly vivid and unpleasant dream but had that on citalopram at first and they are so vivid i often confuse them with real life momentarily i also have bruised and itchy leg
2232,fluoxetine,prozac is great when you first start you can feel a little anxious but hang in there it ha changed my whole outlook on life after being really depressed after a divorce and trying to raise two kid on my own it gave me the confidence to get a job and enjoy working again before it i had little confidence i love laughing again which i do a lot now no side effect for me except feeling a bit weird and anxious for the first few week
2233,alprazolam,i have suffered from severe panic attack for year xanax is the only medicine that ha helped me i dont take it time daily a prescribed i take it only when i have a panic attack it work wonder
2234,prozac,this medication ha been helping me so much i have been taking it for week now and i am happy with the result it is the only medication i have taken that seems to work
2235,prozac,this medicine wa actually doing some good my doctor started me off at mg since i dont respond well to antidepressant such a paxil effexor at first i started actually having the suicidal thought they warned me about for the first week eventually after week i started to notice a difference in my panic attack they were weaker but still bothersome my depression wa also getting better but around month of taking it i still had the cry spell i told my doctor and he bumped me up to mg slowly i really started to notice a bigger improvement it been almost month and my panic attack are very weak a i am able to control them my cry spell arent a bad but i still get them not a often which is great
2236,xanax,i wa prescribed this med because i lost my dad very suddenly recently and suffered my first full blown panic anxiety attack the attack itself wa the usual numbness and tingling sensation hard time breathing and impending doom thought i wa told to take on a a needed basis so thats what i did i started to have the strangest thing happening to my body flu like symptom with hot and cold flash and pain all over my usually high blood pressure kept falling and i wa dizzy and lightheaded my doctor attribute it to anxiety and directed me to take more so we upped my dose and omg the pain wa worse now i know i might just be sensitive to this drug but my friend had the exact same experience with it so beware
2239,xanax,ive been tormented by anxiety since childhood i am year old and have been through a lot in my life ive been diagnosed with depression bipolar disorder and anxiety panic attack add ive been medicated most my life a well my anxiety got so bad in high school that i had to be home schooled i wake up in the morning feeling like my heart will explode for no apparent reason i get intense irrational fear and intense impulse to harm myself because i just cant take it and get frustrated i start throwing and breaking thing i cant stand to be alone a lot of the time xanax work fast and calm me down without knocking me out depending on the severity of my attack i take up to mg no le than mg
2240,prozac,i feel fantastic i feel a massive change in myself im le aggressive anxious depressed and agitated im more patient with thing and people a i suffered with social anxiety im more outgoing and thinking clearer i feel on top of the world and have lost kg a my appetite ha decreased rapidly
2241,prozac,it obviously affect everyone differently ive been taking fluoxetine for about year mg per day yes it ha some side effect which are difficult to anticipate and manage it can make me overly excited and at time a little euphoric which arrives quickly making it difficult to contain on the other side i suffered from manic depression and i used to happily go into a black hole in a blind rage and the medication just stopped that completely so i feel like it a very positive trade off i do get very sleepy and tired so honestly i just sleep more i tried reducing my dosage a couple of time over the year ive been taking this but could not handle the withdrawal
2242,adderall,i take milligram a needed for school i take it right before school maybe around am school start around am ive noticed extremely dizziness i get hot so easily even more anxious so much more depressed so tired terrible headache and excessive talking i wake up in the morning to bump into every possible wall my vision is completely blacked out i cant walk for more than a mile without feeling faint i eat well and drink lot of water due to a horrible experience with vyvanse in which i lost lb not only that but falling asleep is killer ive never taken such a small dose and have such poor result
2243,alprazolam,thankfully i only took this med for a few week and at the lowest dose possible i wa taking mg time a day for a few week until my long term anxiety medication started to kick in this medication truly doe help for extreme anxiety and panic attack but should only be used shortterm the use of this medication for any longer than a month on a daily basis is a recipe for disaster this drug can be very addicting and is really hard to come off after longtime use luckily i researched this drug and knew this shortly after taking it so i wa aware because the doctor never informed me of the risk
2246,prozac,i have spent a lot of time reading thread on prozac they have all been very helpful during these past few month so i thought i should share my own experience just in case anyone out there might find it helpful i started prozac mg about month ago i always knew i had anxiety and mild depression and wa always curious about taking antidepressant but when my boyfriend and i broke up i literally went to my psycdoc the very next day i had done my research on adrsquos and thought that prozac would be the best for me my doc agreed i kept a log every single day i took prozac starting from day until day it took day before i started feeling little random burst of happiness but up until day it wa pure torture it hurt to smile i completely lost my appetite i could not sleep i wa sad i experienced soooo much anxiety is wa painful but thanks to reading all these thread i did not give up and wa hopeful that thing will get better just a everyone said it will every day after day just seemed to have gotten better and better and on day it finally hit me and i understood what prozac is all about yes it is true that it is a life saver if i had to put it in just two word to explain how i feel on prozac i would have to say ldquocalmrdquo and ldquoclearrdquo but irsquom not finished just yethellip after a few week i started feeling like the mg wasnrsquot really working so my doc increased my dose to mg this time around i almost gave up and went back to mg but thankfully i did not for week of taking mg i wa soooo tired fatigue and lethargic i did not experience this on mg and i wa constantly hungry too so after week i called my doc so i can make an appointment to go back down to mg he wa out of town so i had to wait when his office called me back to schedule me in the awful side effect of mg were gone and i wa back to feeling clear calm and happy again so here is my own personal advice from my own journey with prozachellip irsquove been on it for a little over month you have to get worse before you get better no matter what you think you will get better prozac is literally reprogramming and rewiring your brain and that take time side note irsquom year old and exboyfriend and i are back together and happy so were all those day of torture worth it it sure wa
2247,adderall,i liked how focused it made me however if i wa agitated it made it worse
2248,xanax xr,mg of alprazolam xr at night and sleep like a baby no side effect no need to increase the dose it a wonder medicine for me because i cant stop my mind racing but this doe

2268,alprazolam,i wa prescribed xanax by my psychiatrist because of severe anxiety i wa started on mg to be taken at night it ha been the best medication prescribed for my condition a it also helped slow down the suicidal thought which were on a daily basis i am still taking xanax under gp supervision a it help relieve the level of anxiety tremendously it is the best medication ever made for people who are born prone to anxiety throughout their childhoodadolescence and extreme shyness yes shyness i also take it in conjunction with antidepressant aropax which helped with my depression but also with my unfortunate disability of extreme shyness which wa a constant problem for me a an adult basically all my life

2271,prozac,so i have always suffered from anxiety and i went to therapy for a while and my therapist suggested seeing a mental health nurse practitioner who can maybe set me up with something she referred me to the doctor who prescribed me prozac and it been working great ive been on it for about a month now the first two week were a little rough i wa feeling more depressed and experienced a loss of appetite and even threw up a couple of time though im not sure if that wa the medicine or if i caught a stomach bug however at about the rd week i started feeling great i wa much happier and more engaged at work ive been feeling so good im starting to think i may have had depression my only complaint is my sex drive is totally gone
2272,xanax xr,this ha been a god send for me it make me feel like im on a more even playing field and ive had le panic attack with only having to take every hour that is also helpful a i am on other medicine for depression and fibromyalgia i would recommend for anyone with anxiety andor panic disorder to definitely try this if you can get your doctor to prescribe it for you a it is becoming harder and harder to get the medicine that actually work for u because they think we will all become addicted i always say give u the medicine we need for our problem that work and well worry about the rest later

2279,xanax,please be very careful and i repeat very careful my doctor prescribed xanas to treat my panic disorder from underground station london phobia of being under the earth surface i wa managing fine with other medication such a vistaril which did a great job but wa keeping me tired almost two month later i asked my doctor to take me off them because xanax just make me want to sleep and sit on the coach doing nothing we tried all dosage and i still felt sad inside here is the shocking part only day after my last dose which wa weaned slowly over two week i had my first ever seizure at the age of i never had seizure no family history never ever will i touch this stupid medicine again never
2280,xanax,xanax ha helped me tremendously i wa having severe anxiety attack real bad my doctor at the time worked next door with in the same bulidingoffice and he had witnessed my attack and finally prescribed me just mg xanax and he told me to take half in the morning and half at evening it took a while but finally i wa attack free i feel like i can live my life now
2281,fluoxetine,i took this medicine for day lost my appetite the rd day worsen my insomnia it did not help with anxiety by the th day i felt even worst finally decide to come off it this is my second day off prozac and i still can not eat sleep still have bad anxiety and feeling sick to my stomach and can not eat anything im extremely nauseated havent ate much in day i hope my appetite come back soon this med did not work for me it made me feel horrible
2282,prozac,i had been taking this for a really long time and it workedfor a while i take mg and it seems to be doing nothing now i wa just prescribed a booster and i really hope it work i am miserable i have moderate to severe intrusional thought
2284,prozac,i had taken prozac for year and had been off for year in the year that i took it it wa really amazing i stopped having irrational thought stopped feeling hopeless and could make a decision without going crazy i stopped taking it after year thinking that i may not need it any more the depression came back gradually during this time getting worse day by day nothing bad wa happening in my life during this time my doc classifies this a clinical depression so currently i am back on prozac and feel normal again i realize that i may have to take it for a long time and i am perfectly fine with that
2287,fluoxetine,it work it wasnt the magic bullet for me wellbutrin wa it for me but i still take this in a mg dose to help with thing mainly still taking it because i wa tapered down from mg which wa giving me sexual side effect while simultaneously upping the wellbutrin and have been stable ever sense so dr just want to let it be because it working going to ask for a reduction in this next time though a i feel that the wellbutrin is most likely enough on it own at the high dose i am currently on mg this medicine is definitely worth trying and work for lot of people just wasnt the end all be all for me personally
2288,fluoxetine,i have been taking mg daily for just over week now my doctor said it usually take week to work but i swear i started feeling better after only two dos at first it made me feel lazy but that is going away now i usually have a bit of anxiety and depression all month long but i am legitimately emotionally unstable and mentally insane right before and during my period in the past three week since being on this medicine i have had a few small bout of depression but i havent felt any quotdeep emotional painquot like i usually do my feeling of intense desperation and loneliness are gone i did get angry at my mother a few day ago but i wa able to calm down much faster than i normally would i hope this continues to help
2290,prozac,did not have the best experience with this medication but antidepressant and anxiety medication react differently for each person for the month that i wa on prozac it improved my anxiety but every time my dosage wa changed my depression got much worse and fluctuated greatly it got so bad that i had to switch medication again every medication reacts differently for everyone
2291,fluoxetine,i take this medicine primarily for obsessive compulsive disorder but i also have depression and general anxiety disorder that it help with i took it several year ago but it pooped out on me and my psychiatrist decided to try it again about two year ago i worked up to mg because she said that i needed a really high dosage i take it when i wake up in the morning and find it activating it so weird because i find thing that i realize i do now that i wouldve never done before being on this medicine it such a good feeling each time i realize that and am reminded of how far ive come i love this medication and really really hope i can stay on it this time and not have it poop out on me
2292,alprazolam,for my sleep anxiety depression i have been on many different benzos there are different compound in the benzo family the one ive tried at least one in every compound the one ive tried ativan clonazepam oxazepam temazepam valium triazolam and even midazolam which is used in iv sedation all which have done nothing i have severe trouble staying asleep through the night even on first night of all listed above no improvement i woke up every hour to hour and a half and people say midazolam put them out not me but i got xanax and wow what a difference it made so far instead of waking up every hr on the hr out of hr gone to waking up only time my dr prescribed mg at bedtime been on only mg for day but wow
2294,fluoxetine,i started taking prozac back in after my mom died at time i get very depressed but because of prozac ive been able to live a better life although there are other medical and health problem that i have such a being wheelchair bound i still have my moody day but i am better now

2296,prozac,i wa going through a very deep and dark depression for several month prozac wa the very antidepressant to work for me after about week i could tell the medication wa really working i wasnt having constant ocd related circling thought that made my depression worse and i wasnt on the verge of cry every second this pill is a miracle for me no side effect maybe weight gain but im also eating again when before i wa barely eating and dropped lb definitely take the medication at night because itll make you tired if you take it in the morning
2297,fluoxetine,i would have to say this medicine really saved my life i couldnt even go through life at first i started to believe that i would deal with anxiety forever i highly recommend this medication to anyone suffering from anxiety at first my anxiety got worse and i wa nauseous and couldnt sleep but after about two and a half week my anxiety completely vanished i feel better than ever now and im only on the mg anyone wanting to take prozac i encourage you to

2300,fluoxetine,taken for day now i take this with mg ativan x daily a needed first few day i wa tired had a couple weepy moment and nauseafull feeling that made me not want to eat day i had a bout of insomnia so im slowly moving the time i take my med from the evening to afternoon then the morning no real insomnia since just more of a hard time going back to sleep after waking back to sleep within min ive noticed im perkier and friendlier when i talk with people just can feel some tiredness behind my eye in the morning usually until the afternoon i noticed i havent experienced a many body ache i get from my anxiety a i have in the past im hoping these are all good sign this medication is doing the trick for me
2302,fluoxetine,i have been on prozac for a month now i wa hesitant because i have tried antidepressant in the past and they did not agree with me i am shocked at how i am feeling i am calm my social anxiety that i thought wa more of a personality trait is gone i feel compelled to take care of myself i have energy i am happy like many i had a paralyzing fear of june bug i stupidly left my outside light on the other evening and came home to their swarm i unlocked the door and even swatted one away from my ear and walked in the house my heart rate didnt even increase i am a whole new person
2303,prozac,i wa on mg prozac daily for stressanxietydepression after having an eating disorder for year and felt after year i hit a plateau and weaned myself off of it when i missed a dose i definitely felt the anxiety creep back and depression set it but got sick of feeling numb with no emotion and unable to cry even when i wanted to i however after being off of it for a year and trying it again because i know i didnt gain weight on it which wa my biggest fear i am afraid to try another medicine and frankly dont feel like going through the week you have to wait to see if they work i know i liked prozac in all when i wa on it and just hope the plateau i felt is gone
2304,prozac,for year i struggled with depression unknowingly since i could remember never thought to take any action though until a few tragic event happened then came the suicidal thought and such so i went to a doctor and got this prescribed to me prozac mg i can honestly say i have never felt so good in my life havent had any suicidal thought or anxiety or very much depression the only thing i can say negatively about this medicine is that it did decrease my sex drive and left me feeling quite tired and with a lack of energy when i first started taking it lasted about day ever since then no such problem have occurred except for the lack of sex drive thank you prozac you honestly saved my life
2305,alprazolam,xanax is wonderful for anxiety and panic attack i can thank this medication for making me a normal person for being able to walk anywhere where there are people and feel absolutely no anxiety whatsoever it given me my life back
2307,alprazolam,i wa prescribed regular xanax in the early s for anxiety and it changed my life for the better i wa more productive than ever my relationship got back to where they should be and i wa finally sleeping well a time went on my tolerance increased and i suffered significant peak and valley between dos throughout the day xanax xr wa complete game changer for me a completely different medication i take it in the morning and feel great all day long and i sleep well i still take the regular xanax on occasion if my anxiety flare the xr version is far better but much more expensive the mo is nothing when it come to quality of life
2308,prozac,my depression improved but a concern i have been experiencing is sensitivity to sun light
2309,adderall,added mgday to wellbutrin i dont space out anymore and actually do thing start to finish my doctor said wellbutrin may decrease the effect of stims and lengthen effective time i dont experience any crash with this combo but have noticed that some effect from the wellbutrin are a little le this combo is for me for now but expect will need to change a tolerance grows needed mg in the am to begin therapeutic effect definitely could go to bed while on this dont seem to experience any of the common side effect or any speediness actually increased my appetite wellbutrin suppressed
2310,xanax,i used to work for a bank and i wa being helped by one of my colleague on opening an account for a customer i wa making many mistake i began to panic and i wa sweating profusely the customer wouldnt make much conversation with me because they felt they were making me nervous i had to excuse myself to take a breather in the break room xanax ha helped me become more relaxed and socially open with stranger i feel like my job interview are going to be pleasant now the only side effect i experience is tiredness after the medicine wear out but that only lasted for about hour for me
2311,adderall,this is a great medicine for focus but it ha a downside to it a well it can cause chest pain so you must be careful with usage
2312,xanax,amazing for anxiety and panic disorder but another wonderful thing about xanax is it will even help take the edge off of the common cold and the flu i have carpal tunnel arthritis and osteoporosis an it help relax the joint and muscle just enough to get a good night sleep a quotwonder drugquot it doe have some major downfall also like longterm deppendency
2314,xanax,work almost immediately get rid of chest tightness anger emotional rollercoaster just doesnt last a full hour
2316,fluoxetine,i started on fluoxetine yr ago in high school my panic attack came sparingly and i fought it out for around month i noticed a difference week into starting fluoxetine i used to get a panic attack and almost always throw up this is not the case anymore im on mg and i do great ill get heightened anxiety maybe once every couple of month the best i can describe panic attack now is a quotbuzzingquot feeling in your brain most of the time i can just breathe and it will go away i have noticed no side effect
2317,amphetamine,this product is terrible took it for month nothing at all my doctor is writing me a new product this week the taste is terrible may be my chemistry but no good
2319,fluoxetine,i suffer from major depressionanxiety i would cry panic and feel negative about everything i tried lexapro in my teen and it worked great for me however when it returned year later my doc suggested mg prozac a it would be more quotenergizingquot the first week were unpleasant side effect such a fatigue increased anxiety and insomnia after the rd week up until the th week i did gradually feel better i didnt cry or really feel depressed anymore however at the th week it seemed to stop working i began to feel more anxious than depressed again and felt very uneasy all the time plus i experienced digestive issue also i feel no more energized whatsoever prozac helped me somewhat but it didnt really do it for me
2320,xanax,i wa prescibed xanax and it work well for thing like panic attack i do not like that it make me loopy by taking my prescibed mg and if i cut it in half i feel that it doesnt work at all xanax work very well for short term anxiety and if highly addictive so it is best to take it when you absolutely need it a prn that is supposed to work like xanax but isnt addictive start with a v so ask your doctor about that
2321,alprazolam,great fast acting med work extremely well but the short lasting nature keep me from giving it a
2322,alprazolam,i wa prescribed this by my doctor a a fast acting release from anxiety attack it helped me come off all medication for my anxiety disorder now i only take niravam when im having a bad anxiety attack which is now very rare
2323,alprazolam,after year of talk down therapy i reached a breaking point a doc gave me xanax and it wa a miracle i wa able to go to store and travel on airline without panic attack i have been on xanax since mg before bedtime this ha given me my life back i do take more for long flight where i spend to hour inside the airline system i started on mg daily and year later still use the same amount if i miss a dose more than a day i get antsy then clammy skin and finally unjustified panic attack on rd or th day this is well expected and acceptable response to quitting abruptly doc ha been up front about me using this or some other drug for the rest of my life it is well worth it
2324,fluoxetine,i am diagnosed a having bipolar disorder and for year been suffering and have difficulty sleeping if i did sleep i dozed for more than hour and have no energy after my psych doc changed my antidepressant from surmontil to fluoxetine i just notice it immediate effect after day i have energy my sleep wa good my thought are clear i just hope that this effect would last a this medicine put a smile on my face a having more motivation and being positive
2325,fluoxetine,i took fluoxetine for chronic depression and anxiety at mg just had a little dry mouth at mg it began to work amazingly on my mood i had experienced a major emotional lifechanging event just a few day prior but after taking mg for a few day i felt great i didnt realize how wonderful i could feel after year of recurring depression and anxiety eventually the side effect just got to be too much though the most obvious one wa the awful insomnia i woke up in the middle of the night and could not get back to sleep every single night within a week of upping the dose it affected me so much i had to take a sleep medicine after a few week i started to have vivid dream and had trouble differentiating them from reality
2326,xanax,it work wonder xanax ha made my life so much easier i am on mg x a day and i feel like im happier and more out going i dont know what i would do without it i give it star
2328,prozac,ok i felt better two day in to treatment then a week in i am calm two week in still calm just even finally ive struggled with rapid heartbeat sweating panic fear talking too fast gasping for breath because i have so much anxiety and just a general uncomfortable feeling my whole life of course xanax and med like that worked but when they wore off the anxiety would come back worse this drug prozac like why didnt i try it earlier ive been on many other antidepressant and only cymbalta came close on mg and my headache and muscle tension are also reduced i hope this last the only side effect early waking and waking up a few time at night but i just take some benadryl and i sleep through the night
2329,fluoxetine,ive battled depression for five year and anxiety since i wa a kid the first two week on prozac everything got ten time worse i couldnt function or stop cry or hating myself but after that the depression subsided im more confident calm and i shy from negative thought and sadness rather than welcoming those thing like i used to it ha helped my depression an incredible amount but i have seen a little le improvement in the anxiety even with cognitive behavioral therapy side effect for me are lot of yawning and loss of appetite
2330,fluoxetine,i just started to take this medicine day ago and although i feel good and i seem more calm i experienced vomiting is that normal also i am overweight and my husband ha been complaining of me snoring for the last two day he is so happy because he said i am not snoring any longer so let see what happens
2332,prozac,ok this is my third review in just le than a year here are the pro weight loss pound lost eliminated my anxiety issue no more klonopin very calm cool and collected attitude improved vision and i feel great i can give presentation in front of many people without hesitation or anxiety buildup now for the con be careful drinking alcohol after taking your daily dose i have experienced severe impairment after just a few drink that i normally handle with ease usually it happens if i forget to take my dose in the morning and take it after work instead if i dont give it time to metabolize in my system and drink on it beer can feel like be mindful of that and do not operate machinerycars
2333,alprazolam,i wa on xanax for a couple of year for severe panic attack i started out on mg and soon that wa not enough i had to keep increasing the dose a my panic and anxiety increased i ended up becoming agoraphobic i could not leave my house without taking a handful of xanax first in the end i wa taking way way way too much enough to kill an elephant i know it sound hard to believe it amazing i am still alive i had to beg my insurance company to put me in the hospital to detox i tried to kill myself i almost died while in the hospital they took me down to mg a day and i had a grand mal seizure and almost died it wa the most horrible experience of my life be careful it highly addicting
2334,alprazolam,i have suffered from a very severe anxiety and panic disorder all of my life i wa given xanax about a year ago because the medication i wa taking were not working i started taking the xanax which did take care of the panic attack for the most part but what i did not realize is that though i wa taking the dosage that the doctor had prescribed to me i wa blacking out and getting very violent or i would be asleep my eye would open i would punch my boyfriend in the face and try to choke him then go back to sleep like nothing even happened the morning after these event he would wake up on the couch and tell me what i had done i did not remember doing any of this it wa terrifying
2335,prozac,i have been in this medicine for month first started on mg now increasing to mg i am taking it for depression and anxiety it take about a month before i see some effect mood wa lifted and feel calmer but cant stop yawning in the beginning i did felt increased anxiety before this subsidesi will continue to take this medicine and hope to get better
2337,adderall,having add ha been a bumpy ride for me especially when it come to finding the correct medication a a mechanical engineering major my work load is very heavy and being able to focus is essential and adderall xr certainly give me the ability to do so ive been taking mg xr for about year prior to adderall i took vyvanse and concert which did not work a well for me a adderall it also took me a while to work adderall into my schedule a efficient a possible a i dont like taking it everyday but ive got to say i found a happy medium that allows for the least amount of side effect and it is working absolute wonder for me
2338,prozac,i wouldnt give prozac anything greater than a mainly for the fact that i have been on this now for month mg daily increased my terrible mood followed by anxiety attack i have become an insomniac my pulse ha increased terribly and my appetite is zero without the back up quotxanaxquot i would still be at square i occasionally drink to get drunk but have been recently informed that this drug mixed with alcohol ha a severe risk of suicide i wa not depressed before i wa referred to this medicine but now i feel that it is becoming worse am i miss diagnosed
2341,fluoxetine,i have been on the med mg for about week for depression luckily no side effect and already feel load better dont get me wrong i have had the odd really low day but dont we all but positive feel i can cope lot better plus not eating for the sake of eating still got to help myself to get motivated wished i wa honest with myself year ago and went on medication
2342,prozac,my genius psychiatrist started me on this drug in the fall of the first few week i felt even worse than before i had started taking the fluoxetine after many month on the drug i wa eventually taking mg a day and having manic thought amp episode my psychiatrist decided i wa bipolar and then started me on seroquel rather than give me a break for my nervous system to readjust to it natural state which i also ended up taking for about month and at about the same dose in retrospect i wish i hadnt taken either fluoxetineprozac or seroquelquetiapine
2343,fluoxetine,mgday of fluoxetine work wonder for my pmdd i found it to be so beneficial that i asked for a daily prescription rather than week per month only drawback wa inability to orgasm which i felt wa detrimental to my physical relationship with my husband i switched to wellbutrin a a daily antidepressant found it to be very motivating and with no sexual side effect after month on wellbutrin though i started to notice that my pmdd wa creeping back in and i wa more irritablesnappy than before on a daily basis now i am experimenting with daily wellbutrin plus week per month of fluoxetine last cycle went really well i think fluoxetine is a miracle mood stabilizer if only it werent for the sexual side effect
2345,adderall xr,i take mg adderall xr daily for adhd i feel extremely productive focused and proactive while on it my first day taking it i usually am a normal eater i could only eat a sandwich bag of pretzel before losing any appetite that night despite eating almost nothing i biked mile my standard biking route without stopping in record time without even feeling exhausted now each day i take it i feel very intelligent and concentrated and come up with idea easily a well a feeling great all of the time in my opinion adderall is the greatest thing to grace humankind and i would suggest it to anybody who ha difficulty focusing especially if you are overweight i lost lb in my first month taking it though
2346,fluoxetine,i have been taking prozac for anorexia nervosa i started ever since i wa it ha helped me with gaining weight it suck though cause i wa at a normal weight i have noticed a slight change in my used to be constantly screaming at myself telling myself i cant have the food i want that voice is kinda gone although it is starting to come backi have done all i could so thats why my doctor put me on this medi am taking mg nowthey might be upping my dose soon though
2347,xanax xr,the medicine itself i didnt have an issue with although i still prefer klonopin but it wa the withdrawal i couldnt handle i wa on this medication for two month and since like i previously mentioned i decided to go back on klonopin i stopped taking the xanax xr when i did i felt like a bus ran over me i felt shaky drowsy and like id been out drinking the night before which i havent done in year it really wasnt worth the withdrawal
2350,fluoxetine,i began taking prozac in january i started out on mg i noticed a positive difference in my mood le irritable and happier after only week after about a month i bumped up to mg and thing were still great i did really great on it a far a side effect go i had none thing were great for month and then it sort of just stopped working my doctor bumped me up to mg but it did nothing i built a tolerance for it and recently switched to trintellix overall prozac worked really great until i built a tolerance for it
2351,xanax,it help me from having severe anxiety attack i do go through normal emotion so i only take them when i get too overwhelmed and i am going to have an anxiety attack they are very helpful
2352,adderall,i have adhd amp narcolepsy i recently started adderall after trying a few other medication so far the adderall ha been a god send i hope it continues to help me with my problem

2354,fluoxetine,i went on fluoxetine mg when i wa for depression and anxiety and it initially worked wonder i lost kg it cleared my skin up and gave me a glow i had not had in year my mood picked up heap and i felt amazing on the down side it caused severe migraine and insomnia to the point i would sleep minute a night i came switched to citalopram and have recently been antidepressant free for month i am going to go back onto fluoxetine a it really worked for me and will see how the side effect go round
2355,fluoxetine,ive been on fluoxetine for about week now i started at mg then went up to mg after a week the side effect were terrible the first several week extreme fatigue vomiting anxiety major twitching however i chose to stick with it and hope for the best the side effect started fading after about week and i also started taking the med at night which helped with the daytime fatigue i can now say my generalized anxiety ha almost disappeared and ive felt improvement with my mood and have become more positive my doc ha upped my dose to mg so hopefully this brings even more result i encourage everyone just starting this medication to try to make it through the start up side effect
2356,xanax,after a recent medical diagnosis i had a difficult time coping and felt a tremendous sense of fear and worry constantly brought me to the point i wa physically ill everyday and having panic attack frequently xanax is wonderful when you find the right dose too much and i became a zombie mg wa my perfect dose it brought me down from panic and allowed me to take a step back and deal with my problem rationally
2357,fluoxetine,im taking this for general anxiety disorder and major depression disorde mg it been a couple of month it work great nicer and happier and i have lost pound i have tried to get my medicine right the past year by trying everything i wa on celexa wa on a few year gained a lot of weight and stopped working latuda strattera pristiq vyvanse im allergic to the only problem is prozac doesnt mix well with concerta that i took a long time ago it used to work so well now i tried it with prozac and it cry all day long so going back to dr soon need to find something else to mix in with my prozac
2358,adderall,my life wa sleep before i started adderall taking mg twice a day and im still tired but not sleeping like i wa before only been taking it for a few day but ha helped a lot i only slept and worked and sadly that wa my life for year
2360,fluoxetine,i have been on prozac since i wa i had huge depression anxiety ocd and pst problem i wa so anxious i couldnt even take the pill for the first month because i thought it wa going to kill me seven year later i am a different person i now have a partner and child before this would have been impossible i can also deal with stress much better and my rage and anger ha also calmed down the only downside to this medicine is the weight gain i have gained stone due to prozac but i would rather be overweight than suicidal and unable to cope with life
2361,alprazolam,ive tried everything for anxiety which is severe all the time xanax work only issue is the length of time it last i can feel the effect almost immediately within minute and continue to feel effect kicking in for a good hour after but after about hour i start to have rebound anxiety from it wearing off be careful of tolerance though since ive been on it ive had to increase x i started of with mg xday and am now on mg xday i dont want to change that but this seems to be a perfect it give me the relief i need a often a my body seems to need it i am so grateful for this drug a my panic is nonexistent where it hasnt been in year it been non stop never relief i finally feel relief
2363,prozac,it took about day to kick in but wa the saving grace of getting me through postpartum depression and being able to function normally with my son
2364,alprazolam,first time taking xanax today and i feel great the doctor prescribed me mg every hour but i took a and it helped tremendously i am calm and able to function all those anxious and negative thought just slip away
2365,alprazolam,very good for insomnia and stress which lead to depression no side effect
2366,prozac,i honestly feel that this medication saved my sanity and my life after going through an extreme amount of stress in a short time and then having a miscarriage i started having extreme panic attack out of the blue i wa having them almost every day one night i wa laying in the couch for four hour shaking uncontrollably and thinking i wa going to die finally saw a psychiatrist who put me on mg of prozac per day at first it made me dizzy and gave me headache and i couldnt sleep i wa ready to give up and try something else but finally after about full week i started to feel better and the panic attack stopped havent had an attack in over month and i feel like myself again i am also taking mg of klonopin to sleep
2368,prozac,i started prozac mg day ago the first week i wa feeling very anxious dry mouth numbness in my face but that wa only the first week now i feel so much better i can say on the day i started to feel more focus my fear went away and today is my day and i feel good just great thanks to god and prozac
2371,xanax,i havent seen a xanax in the u from a u pharmacy with the name brand xanax scored on the pill in over year these had no taste real xanax have a very distinct taste and it never melted in my mouth xanax always melt in my mouth within a few minute ive seen video on youtube of people pressing them my advice is get a prescription from a doctor and get them from the pharmacy because that wasnt the first time i saw these the street are flooded with these bar
2373,fluoxetine,prozac wa the worst for me wouldnt recommend it to anyone i wa using it for depression and anxiety and when i first started taking it i felt terrible stayed on it for another month or so till my psychiatrist who did absolutely nothing for me spent a total of minute with me in appts uped my dose to mg i started feeling really tired all the time got headache felt sick my head wa always foggy couldnt remember much drained me right out so without my doctor word i stopped taking it and i still feel depressed and anxious but i feel much more alive and much better prozac didnt work for me at all
2374,prozac,started taking lexapro about a year ago made me so tired i couldnt function felt like a zombie would sleep for hour every afternoon not normal for methen started having quotbreakthroughquot anxiety attack i also suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder doctor switched me to mg prozac and life became better my ocd became manageable anxiety attack became almost obsolete i decided i didnt need it anymore so i stopped taking it i am now going through a divorce and custody battle unrelated issue and my anxiety attack are very bad i have resumed taking prozac in hope of better day day now and have only had attack finger crossed

2394,prozac,i have been taking prozac now for plus year originally wa told by md that it would be temporary but my experience ha been after trying to be off it for several month that i need to go back on it i put myself under depression but i had anxiety too after the birth of my first child i developed a real neurosis about sleep i couldnt shut my brain off at night and had insomnia became afraid id never sleep again being on the lowest dose of prozac helped me i would say completely at three week i despaired of ever feeling normal again and by the fourth week saw a real improvement by six week wa very happy and relieved it may be losing it effectiveness somewhat after all these year
2395,fluoxetine,took it for about five day and havent been able to eat or sleep had pain in my chest so i stopped taking it this morning and ive had an extremely high heart rate all day doctor were worried but the ecg looked ok they said i still had racing thought and anxiety just didnt work for me

2397,prozac,i have limited history with psych med amp i haven only tried two other antidepressant zoloft and remeron both were awful for me side effect outweighed any minimal benefit they may have had but since taking prozac nearly two week ago my mood ha changed entirely i take it in the morning and it give me a sense of purpose and excitement to experience the day before i wa having panic attack so bad before work i would consider calling in prozac ha not had any negative ssri side effect like i had with sertraline but i am going to continue paying attention to how i feel over time on this my anxiety is minimal and melatonin currently ha me sleeping like a baby i hope it never stop working for me for now this medicine is great
2398,adderall,i started this when i wa year old diagnosed a adhd i have had problem my entire life with struggling to stay awake in general excessive daydreaming and socializing this medicine turned my life around not only wa i able to stop daydreaming finish a task and make a list for the first time ever i felt more confident carrying on group conversation i also lost a lot of weight which i did need to do

2400,fluoxetine,ive been taking mg for five week and i feel nothing but worse more sluggish more depressed more unfocused and not just depressed a i wa but angry and depressed
2402,amphetamine,my year old son wa given this in the past month we switch from quillivant xr this is much better for him he think much more clearly can focus have a conversation he doesnt have the anxiety that quillivant wa causing or the emotional crash when the medicine wore off it very expensive even with insurance since it so new but the doctor gave u a discount card to make it very affordable and another problem is all pharmacy dont carry it overall much better for his adhd and le side effect his school even noticed an immediate difference
2403,prozac,i started taking prozac two year ago and i thought it wasnt doing anything for me so i cut cold turkey which i do not advise because you could become very suicidal and i did not take it for month just about a week ago i started taking it again and i have to say i feel so much better i realized prozac wa working for me because i wasnt having intense feeling anymore when small thing upset me i wa able to cope with them more and now when i look back on when i wa taking it year prior to my cut off i remembered i did better than when i wasnt taking im really pleased on this medication and im glad i take it yes i still get upset but i do not go from being a to a remember it not a magic pill it is only to help
2405,fluoxetine,i am a year old woman who seemed to be depressed all the time i wa always depressed and cry now i never get depressed and seldom do i cry and thing that bothered me they dont affect me much now this ha been a godsend for me
2410,xanax,about a year ago i wa diagnosed with severe anxiety with panic attack anxiety run in my family so for me it wa not a huge shock for me to have anxiety i have tried about three different medication that just made me feel awful i did not feel like myself and i wa always sleepy once i got put on xanax with another type of anxiety medication it helped subside my panic attack anytime i would have a panic attack i would take a xanax and it would help me be able to fell like myself again i do not take xanax every day just because i do not have panic attack everyday and because it is highly addicted for me this medication worked
2411,adderall xr,adderall xr mg doesnt help me at all i cant tell i took it the manufacturer is activas pharm
2412,adderall xr,worked perfectly for the first week mg my mind wa completely clear and i felt almost no anxiety whatsoever second weekmg started feeling suicidal worst ive ever felt in my entire life parent thought it wa out of character i couldnt stop cry worst emotional pain ive ever felt ive never felt like that before wa convinced it wasnt the medication but felt better a soon a i stopped taking it if youre feeling this way while being on it it probably the medication i wa convinced that it wasnt until i started seeing that a couple other people had similar reaction female
2413,adderall xr,i am only giving this a because it definitely made a change in my ability to concentrate for long period but it wa not a pleasant experience a soon a i took the medicine it would make me feel exhausted and tired i would have to fight the tiredness to get any benefit out of it by the end of the day i wa drained it also made me extra agitated i couldnt focus on more than one thing at a time so when someone would distract me i would get very irritated i also tensed up my muscle and had bad neckbad pain i switched to ritalin but that wa crap too they put me on vyvanse and it feel similar but le intense than adderall so we shall see
2414,alprazolam,i have a extreme panic disorder and have tried many different medicine for this reason not until i wa prescribed xanax wa i able to settle down slow my breathing and my heart wasnt beating so hard like it wa coming out of my chest
2415,fluoxetine,i have been on prozac for about one month i feel like i am able to function again the only issue i have is that i have no interest in sex and i have gained quite a bit of weight
2416,alprazolam,all started when i wa about year young all typical symptom racing thought palpitation high blood pressure dizzines fear choking feeling chest tightness fear of death and many other unbearable thing which happens when anxiety becomes uncontrollable over the year i have had my good day and my bad day sometimes to a point where i dont want to live anymore but then come good day and to live is the thing i want the most for those dark moment when close to panic xanax ha really helped me it get me a bit calmer straight away and then i can start breathing excercise and other little thing which help to calm down without xanax i honestly wouldnt know what to do
2417,xanax,xanax got me through a year or so of acute anxiety and debilitating panic attack i got rather attached to those pretty lavender pill i called them quotmy darling little easter eggsquot they were so precious in relieving the terror that developed into agoraphobia at max dose i wa so sedated i started calling it quotzombinalquot it had stopped working it magic and under the care of a naturopath i simply stopped taking it amazingly after a couple of shaky day my anxiety diminished and panic attack were history i later learned that between depleted receptor and miniwithdrawls xanax wa actually causing my symptom no more xanax no more panic not even the slightest anxiety i guess i got cured
2418,alprazolam,work great for me cause ive been on every anxiety panic disorder depression medicine on the market prestiq and wellbutrin which i am on now xanax saved my life so far for panic attack the is for mg which for me is a day supply yes my anxiety is that bad i tried to explain my story but something wa acting up and stopped me when i got to the important part ill try explaining later
2419,xanax,it help me a lot and i dont know what id do without it it ha changed my life thank you to whoever made this drug
2420,prozac,made me very irritable and tense
2421,xanax,i suffer from anxiety and mood swing much of it is work stress related xanax ha worked wonder for me no habit i have not experience any side effect and i dont believe is habit forming i only take it a needed i always keep them with me just in case i suffer a panic attack i greatly recommend it
2422,alprazolam,my doctor tried me on a few anti anxiety med prior to xanax i wish it didnt take so long because nothing help me better than this not only ha it improved my life positively when im taking it but it help with a variety of stress we are only human and i believe no matter how pure your life is sometimes you just need a xanax it can be addictive so i do not recommend taking it daily or in large dos
2423,prozac,took paxil for the past year for anxietydepressionpanic stopped it year ago to pursue pregnancy i did well for the st mo but then began to fall apart anxiety panic attack depression all returned i wa put on prozac because it pregnancy friendly about week ago ive had the worst refluxheartburn ive ever had in my life i take the pill at night because it made me sleepy the st day when i took it in the morning im currently on day the reflux is slightly better but i have increased anxietypanic i hadnt had this the st week doe anyone have an similar story i appreciate feedback im not sure whether to stick it out on prozac or switch to a different med
2424,adderall,i gave adderall an out of because it is very effective anyone who is narcoleptic which is why i use this medicine will stay awake completely depending on the dosage you can stay awake anywhere from hour to even more than the down side to this medicine and let me be clear that it is just with my experience is that it can make you jittery and excited it also gave me quotfalse confidencequot and just overall made me more outgoing than i usually also i found that the first time i used it it gave me quite a high which i eventually got used to after several day i started hallucinating thing and got paranoid there are definitely some psychological side effect even more than the one that ive experienced
2427,prozac,i donrsquot find a lot of positive story about antidepressant or i find story where people are taking the antidepressant the wrong way i wanted to share my experience a positive one irsquove had generalized anxiety disorder severe ocd and panic disorder for a long a i can remember my first memory of having an episode wa when i wa year old at my kindergarten interview i feel a though i wa born with the illness mentioned above right from the womb when i wa a child i wa extremely anxious had bad separation anxiety from my parent and had extreme ocd i wa just a kid and thought that the way i wa feeling is how all kid felt i didnrsquot realize that i wa different this went on and got even worse in middle school i began developing trichtilomania in middle school in high school i went from being a above student to failing every class within a couple of year i couldnrsquot leave the house my panic disorder and gad caused debilitating physical symptom i would be shaking when i had to leave the house i wouldnrsquot drink alcohol because i wa afraid of vomiting i wa suffering so much for my whole entire life with severe phobia fear and anxiety i prayed and prayed and prayed to god every night for it to go away i wa a year old living in a prison of her own mind it never went away every single day wa the worst day of my life i would wake up and the thought just started i never had a break my life wa exhausting i am of east indian background and my parent didnrsquot understand mental illness well it is very taboo in my culture i went to ton of doctor and they told me it wa just growing pain no doctor ever told me that maybe i should see a therapist i didnrsquot have any support when i wa i attempted suicide luckily the attempt didnrsquot work and i wa forced to go on medication i wa livid i wa so against antidepressant i wa so so so scared it felt unnatural my general practitioner put me on effexor i took it for almost week it helped me to not want to kill myself but it also made me gain ton of weight which made me depressed and it make me hear voice one evening a voice told me to choke my mom and i started freaking out and my parent drove me immediately to the hospital at the hospital i talked to a psych nurse who calmed me down and got me an appointment with a psychiatrist the next day this appointment and this psychiatrist saved my life and changed my entire life i want to really mention that you should not be going to a general practitioner for mental illness medication you should alwayshellipalways go to a psychiatrist no matter what if your gp is the only person you are seeing to help you manage your med for ocd anxiety etc that is the wrong move that is such a common mistake people are making you need a psychiatrist in order to get the med right please do not just go to your regular doctor yoursquoll be cheating yourself i went to the psychiatrist appointment the next day it wa the first time i had ever seen a psychiatrist i got into her room and we talked about everything my childhood my phobia my ocd she then brought my parent into the room to explain the whole situation to them and the fact that i have a chemical imbalance in my brain and that i have been suffering for way too long my parent were so supportive the doctor told me i wa on the wrong medication that i never should have been placed on effexor which is an snri and that i should be on an ssri considering my main problem is ocd and gad we talked a lot about it and she told me she would like to place me on prozac she said for me because my neural pathway have been the same for plus year that i would need a higher dosage of prozac especially for anxiety and ocd i see on this forum that so many people are on mg or mg for anxiety disorder you should be on mg at least do not be afraid to go higher people that say prozac or an ssri didnrsquot really do anything for their anxiety or ocd is because they are only taking a mg dose that is not an ocd dose mg for anxiety and ocd please up your dose use the medication really use it do not be afraid my doctor started me on mg eventually took me to mg and then i went back to mg yes the side effect are insane i wa nauseated i couldnrsquot sleep i wa shaking i had anxiety but she prescribed me ativan and said to use it until the prozac kicked in that the ativan would keep me comfortable until that happened donrsquot try to be a hero use your ativan or your xanax or whatever to stay a comfortable a possible i could write so much more but irsquoll conclude with this month after being on mg of prozac everyday i woke up one day and i wa cured yes cured i had no ocd i had no anxiety i no longer had fear or phobia i wa cured you have no idea how that day felt it wa like the first day of my whole entire life i woke up being the real me who is free spirited and isnrsquot afraid of anything i wa finally free i wa no longer a prisoner i didnrsquot even have to go to therapy i just woke up one day a brand new person from taking a high dose of prozac every single day do not go off of the antidepressant your ocd your anxiety depression etc will come back i would never dream or even think to come off of my antidepressant i have an illness that will return if i go off the medication because i have a brain disorder ocd is a brain disorder do not stop taking medication for your brain disorder do not try to fix your brain disorder with just a mg or mg dose own your medication be on it for life itrsquos been year since i have been cured if it wasnrsquot for prozac i would be dead you need a psychiatrist do not be afraid to take more than mg of prozac to treat panic attack etc i am on mg a day and my life is a ball it is so wonderful and so carefree do not stop the med be on the med for life

2451,prozac,this ha made such a difference to my life it is like the quotvoicequot that continues to tell me i am too fat and that all the quotbadquot thing in life would be better if only i were thinner ha weakened it is still there but i dont have to listen if fact i can even ignore it what a relief it ha made me realize just how much time i wa spending listening to all the negative thought planning the food covering up the vomiting i finally feel quotnormalquot what a relief
2452,fluoxetine,hi ive been suffering from anxiety panic attack and sometimes depression but not serious depression for around month now due to an experience i had whilst taking mdma i had a panic attack the other night that led to me calling an ambulance because i felt faint fast breathing then when the paramedic arrived my arm went numb due to my fast breathing so i decided to see my gp the next day and he prescribed me with fluoxetine it now coming up to the sixth day of me using this medication and i kind of feel myself calmer but this is only the first week it wa a kind of last resort thing to start and use medication so all finger and toe crossed that i and hope many more can overcome this anxiety and stress problem

2456,fluoxetine,my experience a a man on prozac for year overall it seems to work the best in relieving me of lifethreatening depression in addition it ha the fewest side effect among all the other medication with these two very significant exception while taking it nearly remove your libido which can ruin most relationship if you stop taking prozac youll experience for the next week the strange sensation of electric current zipping inside your head with every change in thought or visual focus you make if you stay on prozac it probably best to be single instead make new and real friendship which prozac allows you the freedom to do good luck
2457,prozac,this is a great drug i wa on paxil for about year it helped but wore off i switched to prozac and had no side effect my energy returned i stopped over eating and napping the fogginess ha cleared

2465,prozac,i have been taking prozac for anorexia nervosa i started ever since i wa it ha helped me with gaining weight it suck though cause i wa at a normal weight i have noticed a slight change in my used to be constantly screaming at myself telling myself i cant have the food i want that voice is kinda gone although it is starting to come backi have done all i could so thats why my doctor put me on this medi am taking mg nowthey might be upping my dose soon though
2466,fluoxetine,i started this medication because i have struggled with depression anxiety and panic attack i have been put on random depression med since i wa year old and am now ive tried lexapro welbutrin and a bunch of other stuff i never really saw improvement a a teenager on these drug but it could have been my hormone at the time i tried prosac at year old and it seemed to make a real difference for me i think i started to feel the difference within the first week but that might have been a placebo affect after at least week is when i think it really started to work and i could feel a difference my anxiety level started to drop pretty drastically and i wa no longer afraid of thing like the dark
2467,alprazolam,my doctor prescribed this to me for the depressive episode a part of my bipolar dx at mg that wa sufficient to stop cry but i wa exhausted mentally perhaps numb not sure if it wa from the depressioncrying or the medicine at mg it knock me out i now use it mainly for insomnia and no more than once a week any more than mg at pm and i will not get up on time for work because this is my own use i confided in a friend who had a stroke and he confessed he had been doing the same thing until his md stopped him i believe insomnia may be a good use for this medicine if used correctly i know it may have addictive potential monitor yourself
2469,xanax,ive been on and off xanax for year it the only drug that make me feel normal after a lifetime of anxiety and depression it awful that people use it recreationally and thats made it difficult to get a prescription for it because of others abuse of it it make me feel normal so obviously i need it i have nothing but good thing to say about this drug it help me not want to freak out and shake due to anxiety if you really need to be on it it amazing
2470,alprazolam,if i dont take it my skin feel like something is biting me and i itch all over i get very agitated and i cant sleep or sit still or focus my attention for a normal amount of time

2478,prozac,a renowned medication to help pmdd but barely helped me helped with my anxiety and depression quite well despite lack of emotion but always got hormonal monthly which wa confusing it actually made some symptom worse on lexapro now so hopefully that help
2480,fluoxetine,i am twenty six year old and have suffered from significant depression since i wa a child for year i just dealt with it always going from one crisis to another ive had a handful of suicide attempt starting from my early teen to young adult year i would especially have trouble during the two week leading up to my period cry episode and just an overall feeling of depression i wa put on prozac about three year ago and it ha made a world of difference im happy again and able to function to my best ability im focused and driven sometimes i forget to take it and the depression come back but a long a im taking my daily dose a prescribed im great
2481,fluoxetine,i lost my sexuality from the first pill overnight it went from to wa told it wa a common sideeffect so i continued using prozac called fontex here i norway after a while i didnt want thouse sideeffect so i stopped using but my loss of ibido and ed continued now year later my problem is still the same doctor refuse to belive me but im certain i had very high sex drive before my first prozacfontex pill no i cant keep my erection more than second and my penis often feel numb this pill should have been illegal sorry for my poor english
2483,prozac,i have been on prozac since i wa i had huge depression anxiety ocd and pst problem i wa so anxious i couldnt even take the pill for the first month because i thought it wa going to kill me seven year later i am a different person i now have a partner and child before this would have been impossible i can also deal with stress much better and my rage and anger ha also calmed down the only downside to this medicine is the weight gain i have gained stone due to prozac but i would rather be overweight than suicidal and unable to cope with life
2485,adderall xr,helped my life entirely im a more productive and clinical learner now didnt realize how bad i wasnt able to stay focused until i took this and noticed the difference sleep and eat fine on it after the first week that is but the lack of appetite restlessness wasnt even that bad even then
2487,prozac,i have had to come off fluoxetine due to severe pain in my back hip and leg it been week and still getting the pain so worried ive damaged myself for good dont know what to do doctor ha put me on naproxen for the pain but how long do i take this for ha anyone else experienced this every time i come off naproxen i get the pain straight back again making me so unhappy
2488,adderall,while not perfect this drug helped me achieve around an improvement in my focus attention and ability to see task through to the end i take mg ir in the morning and mg early in the afternoon i wa never diagnosed with when i wa a kid likely because i barely went to see doctor a a child i used illicit drug my whole life until it caused me to almost kill myself after being clean for a year i noticed my problem persisted with attention focus and finishing task after seeing a psychiatrist and getting a proper testdiagnosis im grateful it helped a lot
2490,xanax,this is a qualified positive review for xanax i wa suffering from mild depression and anxiety last winter and my doctor put me on wellbutrin that stuff take week to work and in the interim it can really up your anxiety level a week later i started mg xanax xday and it took care of the anxiety immediately i continued using xanax for more restful sleep but after about month i realized that short and long term memory wa way down stopped xanax and replaced with gaba and this seems to be a far better solution the wellbutrin worked great felt more energy the first week but did take week to fully kick in i will now only take the xanax for rare severe stress also check the connection to alzheimers
2491,fluoxetine,ive been taking mg once a week for week now it ha helped my depression and quality of life so much until this last week i have been having back to back anxiety panic attack and im not sure what to do about it yet because of the benefit doe this go away my chest hurt and im basically vibrating now every time it happens
2492,fluoxetine,started taking prozac about month ago im taking care of my year old mother who ha dementia and i found my stress and anxiety going through the roof many sleepless night too the positive are that i sleep much better my anxiety is pretty much gone and im much calmer and im handling my mother so much better the negative are no motivation at all photography is my passion but i have not picked up a camera since started this medicine i find myself grinding my teeth all the time loss of libido the worst thing out of it though wa that i lost weight i weighed pound but lost pound within the first month and cant seem to get it back im now at pound and look terribleim going back to doctor next week
2493,fluoxetine,i have suffered from severe depressionanxiety for year now i also suffer from ptsd i have tried almost everything out there and prozac is the only antidepressant that i can take and that work for me i am very sensitive to medication and im glad i have found at least one medication that help my severe depression it help motivate me and keep me alive i have been on mg for a long time and then recently went to mg i think i need to increase my dosage even more so but it ha been the only reliable medication i have ever taken and for the longest duration
2494,prozac,i started with a very low dose to treat depression mg i also had become quite the alcoholic binge drinking right down to the last drop had no motivation and lot of self pity prozac helped me recover my lost personality gave me hope and curbed the drinking to full time sobriety i take mg a day i would suggest that folk give it two month before giving up im glad i did nine month of no drinking and i work full time
2495,prozac,prozac worked well for me with no serious complication or bad side affect a plus for mewas very good memory i used this medication for over year and wish i wa still able to use it the only problem i did have with prozac wa at the end of year i started getting terrible horrible headache so bad that i would cry i no longer can take any ssri and or any benzodiazepine i think maybe after so many year your body isnt able to tolerate it i began having severe breathing problem im now on the trial amp error time again which most of u know that it isnt fun good luck to everyone
2496,xanax,i have severe depression and general anxiety disorder i take mgday of zoloft and that pretty well take care of my depression and most of my panic attack occasionally ill take mg for a panic attack but im cautious because sometimes the downside of coming off a panic attack sends me into a fit of depression i highly recommend both zoloft and xanax i just want to put the word out there to use good judgement when treating a panic attack when you have depression a well
2497,fluoxetine,i have been taking this off and on for year it greatly help with my depression and mood however ive developed anxiety and this doe nothing for it if you are willing to take the med and wait for your depression to get better it will help usually take week to kick in to full swing i dont think id still be here if it werent for these medicine
2498,fluoxetine,yo with anxiety depression i wa given medication for the anxiety originally and then the doctor gave me fluoxetine mg this wa fine the first week no side effect second week i wa living in a constant state of panic beta blocker werent helping and i always had chest pain and severe panic attack i couldnt stand to be in a classroom full of my peer they made me feel paranoid about everyone i absolutely hate these
2499,xanax,i have been on quite a few antidepressant in addition to xanax the antidepressant made my anxiety and panic worse needing to increase my intake of xanax when on the antidepressant i wa really reluctant to take the xanax when i wa first prescribed the medication i have been of pristiq for month now and have lowered my xanax from mg in the morning mg midday and mg at bed i am now taking mg in the morning and mg at bed i am taking vitamin doing yoga and taking better care of myself my doctor know i am honest he wanted me to take mg every hour but never did my mother just died a few week ago and have been getting really bad anxiety and still the same dose help me hope this help
2500,prozac,im a teenager and i have had pretty severe anxiety for about to year it stopped me from doing normal high school thing like going to dance making friend and going to party because those kind thing terrifies me i went to a psychiatrist and since my anxiety ha been negatively effecting my life she prescribed me ml of prozac once a day this ha seriously changed my life ive tried all the natural medication and technique that claim to work but nothing had worked for me it took a while to kick in but once it did i became a whole new person ive been so happy and can do thing without worrying
2503,alprazolam,i take mg a needed when i have an occasional anxiety attack
2504,sarafem,i take mg for just day before i get my period it definitely help with my mood and uncontrollable anger before taking this the silliest thing would make me want to scream when my husband asked me why i take it i tell him that i take it in order to extend his life expectancy enough said only down side insomnia worth it though
2506,prozac,i took this for anxiety panic attack and depression from to it helped me tremendously i literally felt it quotkick inquot after about or day of taking it i wa very skeptical of all medicine ang almost didnt take it but thank goodness i did it made me feel like everything wa quotsmooth sailingquot i gradually weened myself off it because i could not afford the doctor appointment required a part of my treatment plan it wa like returning from an exciting vacation when i stopped the prozac but i am now strongly considering it again due to tremendous stress in my life i have become practically a recluse anyway it worked for me
2507,fluoxetine,well looky here i wanted to see what wa going on with my body and found these interesting post i have been having some issue that are sending me to oncology and talk of leukemia about month ago i stopped going on prozac just to clear out my body with a few different med night sweat were one deal that my oncology doc brought up i have the mutated gene for all the and to go up about leukemia but have not had the bone marrow test yet only because i am a wimp and i have flash throughout the night but she is saying sheet wetting sweat not them but i am ripping off my sheet like i just had my hysterectomy back in why i have flash is beyond me but that prozac apparently took control of them so am back on
2508,fluoxetine,i take fluoxetine for ocd and mild depression it ha helped me so much it took a while to work for me about month to fully kick in it ha been so worth it i just feel a lot more relaxed and thing dont bother me a much i have bad side effect mainly insomnia or over sleeping lack of energy diarrhoea but it is worth being able to get out of bed in the morning i have started being able to laugh for the first time in year i would really recommend it for anyone who is unsure i would say give it a go but give it time to work also be very careful if drinking alcohol it affect you a lot more
2510,fluoxetine,after a year of stress and then going back into my addiction that had been dormant for decade i tried mg of prozac the first week were completely miserable anxiety irrational thought mood swing constant bowel movementsbut i wa diter i rd to hang in there amazingly i started to feel better after week i wa a different person i feel completely normal now my wife wa diagnosed with cancer and thing went really bad in my life before prozac i am now on a much better path i take mg of xanax at bedtime and wake up feeling great it is like a miracle of sort mood side effect a little bit of thinning hair sex drive is down a i find it hard to climax and im a little le empathetic
2511,fluoxetine,so i have always suffered from anxiety and i went to therapy for a while and my therapist suggested seeing a mental health nurse practitioner who can maybe set me up with something she referred me to the doctor who prescribed me prozac and it been working great ive been on it for about a month now the first two week were a little rough i wa feeling more depressed and experienced a loss of appetite and even threw up a couple of time though im not sure if that wa the medicine or if i caught a stomach bug however at about the rd week i started feeling great i wa much happier and more engaged at work ive been feeling so good im starting to think i may have had depression my only complaint is my sex drive is totally gone
2512,prozac,i have never had thought about suicide until i took prozac this wa the absolute scariest experience of my life
2513,prozac,prozac mg worked great for my depressive symptom i had energy and wa motivated i had no issue with weight gain or my sex drive it did however significantly increase my anxiety i had scary obsessive intrusive thought along with bad episode of panic that came out of nowhere i wa scared to drive go over bridge there wa always this fear of quotwhat ifquot everything that i could be anxious about i wa i had a very difficult time quieting my mind and at time i thought i wa going crazy very scary experience overall for those suffering from depression im sure this rx is a godsend but much too quotspeedyquot for my body
2514,alprazolam,i had severe anxiety and panic attack and have tried antidepressant that didnt work and gave side effect for not being the correct medicine wild thought voice and fear consumed me i started with then slowly came off of it taking too long made me mentally slow tried tapering off and taking a needed until i worked through the fear and anxiety ultimately our mind are trying to make decision fighting ourselves and indecision creates mental turmoil that only we can correct by making a choice and moving forward
2515,xanax,when the world is closing in on me i take a xanax and suddenly im able to function again i can learn and adapt and i feel like i can capture and retain information better without it any new information is lost on me and my learning process is inhibited the little stuff is not a problem anymore and i can focus on accomplishing anything i need to i didnt start having anxiety attack until after college i did really well and all of a sudden i felt like in the real world i could not meet the expectation because of how well i did in school everything became too much debt learning a new job reading which is my favorite thing to do being with family and friend i hit a wall even with antidepressant i could not function
2517,alprazolam,ive had severe anxiety panic attack insomnia and agoraphobia for year i wa on valium mg twice a day ive tried ativan and klonopin too xanax is the only one that actually help me feel normal within minute of taking it i can begin to feel it start calming me down this is excellent when youre facing a panic attack no side effect other than sleepiness i can actually get out of the house when i take these having agoraphobia is no fun at all whenever i want to go somewhere i will take my xanax around minute prior to leaving if you suffer from anxiety or any of the thing mentioned this med will help you out tremendously
2518,xanax,excellent for anxiety especially if you start with the minimum amount mg and only take more if needed i say this because i wa prescribed mg x daily and dont need that much try to take the least amount and if that work dont take more since you can build up a slight tolerance over time my only concern is will i ever be able to be off of medicine i just wish there wa a natural cure for anxiety i hate being dependent on this
2519,alprazolam,i have been taking this medicine for a few year now and without a doubt it ha changed my life i never had or have any side effect besides maybe a poop sweat but that also could be from my diet the only thing i have noticed is you definitely develop a need to take more a life go on but if thats what i have to do to avoid those crazy attack then so be it
2520,prozac,i started taking anti depressant after my grandchild died he wa year old and it changed my world i had so much anxiety over people and i wa just so sad and angry all of the time i stated celexa and i loved how it just shut off the bad eventually it wa increased and i couldnt stay awake for anything i got switched to prozac about a month ago at first i felt very irritable but thats gotten better and now i feel better overall no more trying to sleep all day and the crazy switch is still flipped to off
2521,adderall,i knew i wa different when i went to school being an only child i wa very loved and cared for i lived for the attention in kindergarten i knew i wa not like everyone else it took me longer to learn thing than others i wouldnt listen fully to instruction i wa so eager to please i fell over myself trying to prove thing to be accepted i wa outgoing and a class clown my mother always got note home about me thing like she doesnt sit still get out of her seat talk talk talk im grown and my mother ha passed away my best friend therapist ha shown me ptsd and adhd now i know who i am now
2522,fluoxetine,what a life saver and i mean that in the very literal sense ive now been taking mg of prozac for about day the fist week wa hell i couldnt sleep i felt more depressed anxious and panicky than before nauseous and disorientated but stuck with it only now that im starting to feel better do i start to realize how incredibly unwell and out of control ive been for so long im now starting to feel like i have my brain back and am in possession of rational thought again
2523,fluoxetine,all i can say to sum up this drug is that it is absolutely amazing im currently on mg unfortunately you have to wait week for it to fully work but for me it started kicking in around the th week i highly recommend you wait at least week before you decided whether it working for you or not i can easily say fluoxetine prozac ha saved my life and got me out of my worst depressive slump ever my motivation and interest in activity are back and i feel great overall
2524,prozac,i had the worst reaction to this medicine i wa on mg and my body rejected it terribly the first few day were fine and then after the th day or so i became very glazed over and out of it it wa a if i wa a walking zombie i then started waking up in the middle of the night having severe panic attack i had never had one before so i wa very scared my doctor told me to come off of it and the withdraw from this wa even worse i woke up in the middle of the night and had to go to the hospital overall i had a very negative experience but my mom take this medicine and she love it could just depend on the person i guess
2525,alprazolam,ive just switched to klonopin from being on xanax for almost year it worked wonder for me i never abused it and take it responsibly but i did develop a tolerance to it after so long on it one of the best thing about xanax is that it kick in pretty quickly which is a must for panic attack it very hard for me to let xanax go because it the only thing that really worked for my anxiety and panic attack
2526,xanax,xanax ha given me my life back i suffer from severe anxiety a few time a year for no reason ive been given other benzos that leave me feeling like a zombie i can take a tiny amount and im talking of xanax and it calm me down enough to enjoy life
2527,fluoxetine,i have been taking mg of prozac for about five year for my premenstrual dysphoric disorder it ha changed my life and i will never quit taking it before i wa quick to fly off the handle ironically i dreaded weekend because my family stressed me out so much im embarrassed to admit wa not a very pleasant employeecoworker i noticed a difference after about a month of taking it when i realized that im a different person for the better when i first started taking it i wa waking up at about am every morning but that ha gone away i still dont always sleep very well but my understanding is that happens to everyone when they get older
2528,alprazolam,at first i resisted taking xanax because of thing id heard about it but ive got to say it work just remember after a couple of week it can become addictive and you dont want to feel that withdrawal my doctor ha given me a once daily medicine citalopram that took to day to fully take effect but it working great im down to xanax every day or and plan to be totally off of it soon a this new medicine ha fully taken it place now and yes it can be taken with the xanax until you are ready to stop taking it
2529,fluoxetine,cured me from year of binge eating that i thought would be with me until i died i can now say i am extremely happy and healthy and binge free it took me about a month and a half to feel the drug effect so please dont give up i did have terrible side effect for the first week such a stomach ache drowsiness bad dream lack of energy but these all wore off gradually and it wa so worth it
2531,fluoxetine,my story is very long but to get to the point fluoxetine is the only antidepressant that helped me brain injury caused my problem with anxiety and depression i wa born highly sensitive to medication irsquom very thankful for fluoxetine i had some side effect in the beginning and had to work up from mg to over a period of a few month that wa very difficult but the side effect eventually did go away i went from the deepest form of depression possible to a very satisfactory quality of life within a few year i still struggle with issue related to a brain injured person but the fluoxetine wa one of the tool that saved my life and irsquom very thankful for this medication
2536,fluoxetine,day in and i feel gross im nauseous feel blah runny nose read that wa a side effect for quotmaturequot woman light headed and sweating bullet this is suppose to help with the hot flash im trying to be patient ready to quit
2537,adderall,ive taken adderall for year the first month worked very well balanced me out kept me focused amp side effect were minimal but the efficiency of adderall ha really gone down in my experience i often find myself hyper focusing on thing i dont need to amp the side effect have gotten much worse insomnia horrible dry mouth more cavity i get antsy amp shaky at time amp i also feel ive become dependent on it next doctor appointment i will be asking to switch out to something else it a good medicine at first but understand that many of the great review are likely written by newer adderall user
2540,alprazolam,ive taken xanax generic for anxiety and panic attack for seven year ive taken it just a my doctor instructs actually he want me to take it more often and have had no issue with dependency even during period when i needed it three or four time a week i love that it kick in in under five minute i take it a soon a i start panicking and five minute later my mind just calm down it doesnt numb me or get me high it just keep my brain from going into a panic spiral it also help reduce the urge to selfharm the only side effect ive experienced is drowsiness but it usually isnt enough to keep me from going about my day one warning though do not take with alcohol
2541,alprazolam,i wa diagnosed with cervical dystonia in a little after a car accident i went back to work and worked fast and hard a usual and the dystonia got worse shortly after i developed panic attack dr prescribed generic xanax and it really helped i dont remember how much it wa the xanax not only took the panic attack away but my neck pulling would go away for a long time since dystonia came back wvengance no one ha prescribed xanax and keep prescribing crappy medicationsbaclofen flexiril and now atarax im scared to take the atarax i know xanax work and i only used it maybe time a month no habit forming for me kid ruined it for folk that need it
2542,xanax,i asked my doctor if he could give me something a i had been under stress and anxiety for some time i take mg of xanax twice a day i take it about hour before i go to bed so i can relax and sleep not sure if the xanax is causing some weight gain or not
2543,fluoxetine,prozac ha changed my life ive suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder anxiety and depression since i wa in my preteen ive tried celexa and paxil but couldnt sleep at all while using them i asked my physician to prescribe prozac on the advice of a friend and ive had amazing result i started at mg a day and increased to mg a day after a month i noticed that i wa drowsy and unmotivated during the day when i took the medicine in the morning so i switched to a bedtime dose and i havent noticed any side effect since then prozac make me calmer and much more in control of my fear others who didnt know i had gone on medication have noticed a positive change a well ive been on prozac for month
2544,xanax,i wa extremely against xanax because of knowing people who abused it and being someone who will try homeopathic cure before using prescription that said it really help me i have anxiety i would describe a anywhere from mild severe depending on the day and week but sometimes i get in these intensely anxious thought pattern where i can not let go it medication during these period is a godsend it allows me to return back to my normal nonanxious self i rarely have noticed sleepiness a an effect of the medication only when i wa already sleepy before taking it if you dont abuse your dose it shouldnt cause you to feel out of it or have memory loss if you truly suffer from anxiety thats my experience
2547,fluoxetine,this is my second time taking prozac i took it for two year before for panic attack insomnia ocd and it did wonder after a month my head cleared up my memory improved a well a my sleep no longer waking up in the middle of the night worried about thing only downside is that i tend to gain a lot of weight on it a soon a i stopped last time the weight came off almost immediately i plan to watch what i eat and exercise more this time after a month now i have already started feel better and sleeping sooo good
2549,fluoxetine,i can feel some side effect such a visual problem rash in hand
2550,fluoxetine,life saver at first made me feel tired but now i have energy and more out going
2552,adderall,i wa diagnosed with sever sleep apnea when i wa about i have been tired most of my adult life so assume have had apnea a long time tried cpap forget that got a somnodent mouthguard which stopped almost of my apnea but i didnt feel better put on provigil like year not really much better same with drs and i were fed up i could not make it through a day without at least to three short to minute nap and always felt like had a cloud in my brain and my pcp recommended to sleep dr to try adderall i had no idea what adderal wa knew it wa used for adah but really didnt care just went home and took it result have been unbelievable almost never take a nap feel way more refreshed no brain fog
2553,adderall xr,i just recently started taking adderall xr and even though my doctor and i are still trying to find the right dose i have already noticed a major difference since ive started taking it ive been able to get lost in book for the first time because i can actually focus without having to make myself i have noticed a decrease in appetite but it seems more like a newly developed aversion to high calorie food and im wondering if thats not because of the added stimulation from the carbohydrate either way i think it important for everyone to remember there is no magic pill and in order to get the best result you have to change your lifestyle too like making sure to get hour of sleep and eat food high in fiber and cut back on sugar
2554,fluoxetine,some useful advice timeline started mg felt slightly high just a little more positive took mg for day then had major crash lasted about day day to level out valium is very handy just hang in there it will pas amp get better day started feeling much better now on mg day really good now initial day crash a autoreceptors sense too much serotonin and move to regulate level so they drop making you feel like the world is coming to an end once they desensitize thing improve tip stay calm relax talk to people take valium sleep eat carbs distract your thought walk if up to it do not read review will do your head in too many depressed peoplereviews many negative useless review
2555,amphetamine,im on day of adzenys i like that i take it once but the texture is gritty once dissolved it a dissolvable pill so what do you expect i do experience dry mouth and slight decrease in appetite but it nothing serious my doctor started me on a pediatric dose of milligram once a day another problem i see is that im having a hard time falling asleep it could be because i take the medication around oclock in the morning but thats the time i get up so it honestly too early for me to will see once i get a routine going and school start again
2556,alprazolam,this medication ha helped me a lot it keep me calm and it fast acting just take them a prescribed
2557,adderall,work well be sure not to take in evening or night just in the morning and noon though because it will cause sleeplessness
2559,xanax,xanax ha been a great thing for me i wa very scared to take it in the beginning because i had no idea how i wa going to feel but it really calmed me down after two week of thinking i wa going crazy or dying i had never experienced anything like this before but i had to get a blood transfusion for my anemia and all hell broke through my doctor gave me and i only take of that i break it in s i dont want to go to sleep just take the edge off so my advice to anyone that ha to take this even if you have a higher dose just take of it until you see how it will respond to your body i hope i could be a help to someone

2584,fluoxetine,i suffered pmdd that came on exactly day of my cycle for another day i would be incredibly irritable teary depressed high anxiety and ruining the relationship around me i also couldnt study and struggled often to get to work or to even drive myself home from my boyfriend i started antidepressant but then freaked out and stopped then actively tried other option for a whole year before trying them again and coming to term with the fact it wa probably my best option i wasnt expecting them to work the way they have i just feel like a normal human and like my personality is back i can function and i have enjoyment in life that i didnt before havent really experienced any side effect either
2586,xanax,i am year old turning next month and i have panic disorder for a long time im gay and my life wa not easy at all my dad doesnt support me and then i got also depression i take this medication for about year now and i can tell you it work so good and it saved my life i wa afraid of going out in public working etc my life wa terrible with all my anxiety attack and that wa destroying my life if you feel the same talk to your doc and ask for xanax but do not take without prescription it is a drug and you must control it
2587,fluoxetine,i never had any problem with depression until i got hurt at work in since then ive lost home car and have been completely stressed and severely depressed most day i didnt even get out of bed i became very antisocial i wa prescribed prozac and am only on day and i can already feel a difference im up and out of bed i have more energy then ive had in month and i dont feel like everything is hopeless anymore im still having issue with irritability and severe mood swing but hopefully my doctor can treat that with something else overall i couldnt be happier with this medication so far so good not even any side effect to speak of it great
2588,fluoxetine,many people say that they gained weight on this medication i actually lost weight i lost pound in a little over a month that ive been on it i have few side effect the only thing i can complain about is that it make me very sleepy but it take away the depression so im grateful
2591,alprazolam,i take this a needed for anxious situation the dentist i would flee from the office cry if not for the xanax being around large crowd of people etc it certainly take off the edge that accompanies anxiety and help me to be in situation that i normally couldnt it seems to take min to an hour to kick in so i am proactive in taking it to be prepared it been a great help to get me to certain place and be able live life
2592,adderall xr,i wa diagnosed with adhd year ago by my family physician she put me on effexor which seemed to help at first but over the next year the side effect were not worth the result another doctor recently prescribed adderall and when that worked well he gave adderall xr i am so much more centered can concentrate and my quality of life is so much better i hate that it is thought of a a quotstreet drugquot and i hate that the price is so high the generic did nothing for me except to make me agitatedjittery for few hour then crashed and had a headache
2594,alprazolam,when im at my worst or i literally have so many racing thought or i get to agitated i take a half or mg smoke tobacco and im fine it amazing i have not found this drug addictive i only need it when im thinking or on a anxiety attack going to a psychiatrist and am hopefully going to be prescribed it it ha blessed me and made me think clear thought without over thinking best suited if your diagnosed with adhd anxiety panic attack
2595,alprazolam,i typically dislike and try to avoid taking medication whenever possible but with a recent anxiety diagnosis i wa convinced to at least keep some of this on hand in case i need it i must say that i love xanax it really calm me down within about minute of taking it and help me sleep almost irrespective of what is going on but it doesnt leave a hangover effect the next morning im currently in the phase of trying to find a more quotregularquot medication to control my anxietyocd currently trying venlafaxine a the xanax isnt meant to be a daily thing in the meantime im still using this when i feel i need it ativan and valium dont compare
2596,xanax,this medicine ha saved my life tentimesover given me a quality of life on par with others and above all else allowed me to succeed i have had panic disorder since childhood and wasnt prescribed xanax until age now i can do anything i want panic and anxiety free the sky is the limit really this is medicine can save life the perfect freedom gift
2597,prozac,ive been taking this medication for day i started taking it because of severe anxiety and depression i started on mg and within the last day increased to mg the first couple of day i felt fine then i started to feel really anxious im still feeling alot of anxiety but my doctor insists that i continue the medication and the anxiety should subside ive tried so many other medicine and this is the only one ive tolerated this long im hopeful and pray that the anxiety doe go away i can honestly say that my mood ha definitely improved thats why i continue to take it ill keep my finger crossed
2598,prozac,i started taking this medication because my doctor thought that i had too much stress and anxiety in my life which wa causing me to feel like i couldnt breathe i have never taken any antianxiety depression medicine before and wa very skeptical the first few day to the first few week were not so great i felt tired depressed and just plain crappy i worked through it and kept taking the medication i am now a month into the medication and i feel great i can concentrate on class and other task much better without worrying about other thing my relationship are much better with my husband and child so far so good
2600,prozac,i am twenty six year old and have suffered from significant depression since i wa a child for year i just dealt with it always going from one crisis to another ive had a handful of suicide attempt starting from my early teen to young adult year i would especially have trouble during the two week leading up to my period cry episode and just an overall feeling of depression i wa put on prozac about three year ago and it ha made a world of difference im happy again and able to function to my best ability im focused and driven sometimes i forget to take it and the depression come back but a long a im taking my daily dose a prescribed im great
2602,adderall,when i wa in my last year of college i started seeing a psychologist for depression after month she screened me for adhd and started me on adderall it wa ok for a while but she upped my dosage to mg per day that wa too much for me so i quit taking it i noticed the difference when i wasnt on it i felt way le focused tired and my mood were worse when i got a job with insurance after a year i started taking it again it ha helped me tremendously i only take mg per day now
2603,prozac,this is my second time taking prozac i took it for two year before for panic attack insomnia ocd and it did wonder after a month my head cleared up my memory improved a well a my sleep no longer waking up in the middle of the night worried about thing only downside is that i tend to gain a lot of weight on it a soon a i stopped last time the weight came off almost immediately i plan to watch what i eat and exercise more this time after a month now i have already started feel better and sleeping sooo good
2605,alprazolam,it work in association with my antidepressant to bring about a well rounded me but it is there to take when my panic attack hit it quickly take effect and calm me
2606,fluoxetine,i cant remember the exact dose but it wa low it caused insomnia hour sleep a night feeling of giddiness and weight loss lb stone which wa a positive for me because of the insomnia i came off it and wa put on g amitriptyline with this medication i have hour sleep dry mouth and a huge increase in appetite for sugar and carbs but my depression seems to be a bit elevated
2607,alprazolam,i wa taking mg of xanax almost daily for about a year i tried to quit cold turkey by being off of them for about day straight and when day hit me i thought i wa going to die i couldnt sleep for the day i didnt have it constant pacing around the house twitch like crazy and had to get some asap a i wa out it ha been over a month now and i am slowly coming off of the xanax i am down to about mg every day or so and i havent had any additional medication it can be done but you have to prepare yourself for it mentally and tell yourself you can do it i have quit in the past and regret ever picking up the bottle again
2609,alprazolam,xanax ha helped me so much for my depression and panic attack even ha helped a lot with my obsessive compulsive disorder i dont have nearly a many compulsion since ive started taking it
2610,fluoxetine,this isnt a miracle pill but it doe help im a bigger girl wa very depressed wasnt focused couldnt and wouldnt do nothing lazy but this ha helped me with my depression helped me lose weight and helped with my feeling love this im so clam and happy
2612,amphetamine,so far so good help with adhd but le side effect gon na keep using it
2614,alprazolam,i wa switched onto this drug after taking lorazepam ativan which i wa very happy with and had almost no side effect with i started taking it combined with effexor and it wa horrible i would take it pas out for an hour and wake up feeling the same a before i could see how it would be good for a panic attack but for general anxiety it is not very good if you are on a constant dose you will be taking them about to time a day which is too much to keep up with i also found much more intense effect from this drug which i consider dangerous because i dont want to get addicted to them i think the drug is good for anxiety attack but for general anxiety i would ask for lorazepam or klonopin
2615,amphetamine,the only adhd medication i have taken that doesnt have awful side effect it make you more alert and productive with out the headache and and hungover feeling that i get with adderall and focalin i dont think it effect everyone the same but it ha been a real lifesaver for me
2616,xanax xr,my psychiatrist had me on mg xanax ir a needed daily i have severe anxiety and had tried ativan klonopin valium ect none of them seemed to work finally i found that xanax did unfortunately xanax isnt a longacting drug i wa finding that being on such a high dose of ir that i wa having to take it even when i didnt need it for anxiety but just to keep from having withdrawal i wa miserable until i wa prescribed mg xanax xr twice daily it doe pretty well to control my severe anxiety racing thought and ocd i do still take mg xanax ir a needed if im having a hard day with my anxiety or if i have a panic attack all in all i recommend trying this medication for treatment of moderate to severe anxiety disorder
2617,fluoxetine,i loved the effect this had on me however my kid said it made me crazy and mean i first began taking it to regulate my sleep pattern when i had a third overnight shift job several year later i went back on it for depression while trying to raise kid on my own it helped me to lose weight but it made me very moody some year later i returned to it but got no symptom relief just weight loss again
2621,xanax,i live in the uk where it is virtually impossible to get xanax or any benzodiazepine so i am very lucky to have found a good doctor to prescribe it i am year old and the last year of my life were a living hell i have bpd and a very severe anxiety disorder that left me having multiple daily panic attack breakdown and even suicide attempt every doctor told me in the uk we get talking therapy and an ssri for anxiety but never benzos so i suffered on for year and year until month ago i found a dr who prescribed me xanax alprazolam mg time a day mg if needed and it is a miracle drug to me for the first time in my life i live without the constant crippling anxiety i highly recommend this med
2622,xanax,i wa on xanax for a couple of year for severe panic attack i started out on mg and soon that wa not enough i had to keep increasing the dose a my panic and anxiety increased i ended up becoming agoraphobic i could not leave my house without taking a handful of xanax first in the end i wa taking way way way too much enough to kill an elephant i know it sound hard to believe it amazing i am still alive i had to beg my insurance company to put me in the hospital to detox i tried to kill myself i almost died while in the hospital they took me down to mg a day and i had a grand mal seizure and almost died it wa the most horrible experience of my life be careful it highly addicting

2626,prozac,i used fluoxetine specifically to tackle depression and social anxiety within day my anxiety had left relieving my depression i used to take it everyday to handle social situation in high school now i take it before social event and distressing and anxiety provoking situation it helped me a lot
2627,alprazolam,when the world is closing in on me i take a xanax and suddenly im able to function again i can learn and adapt and i feel like i can capture and retain information better without it any new information is lost on me and my learning process is inhibited the little stuff is not a problem anymore and i can focus on accomplishing anything i need to i didnt start having anxiety attack until after college i did really well and all of a sudden i felt like in the real world i could not meet the expectation because of how well i did in school everything became too much debt learning a new job reading which is my favorite thing to do being with family and friend i hit a wall even with antidepressant i could not function

2648,fluoxetine,i have severe pmdd and sarafem ha been a god send being and already going through the change made it worse i take mg each night before bed and have noticed the total difference more laughing le mood swing i would definitely recommend
2649,fluoxetine,i have an yr history of bn purge type i tried lot of antidepressant for my mddgad such a cipralex effexor and zoloft but never anything for bn specifically my new gp suggested i try prozac i started at mg went up to mg then went back down to a i wa running low on med i had some weird side effect such a feeling very anxious and having selfharm thought although not suicidal thought i went to the doctor and my dose wa adjusted up to mg i have now been on that dose for about month and have had no relapse with bn it incredible because ive failed so many time before i still struggle with anxiety and depression but it great
2650,xanax,i have taken xanax for year and it ha been a lifesaver for me when my psychiatrist prescribed it for me year ago i wa just about at the end of my rope i wa cry all the time wa hyperventilating had bout of my heart fluttering and many other typical quotanxietyrelatedquot symptom i wa at the point that i wa afraid i wa dying or going crazy over the year my dosage ha been adjusted to work with my life at the time but i have always taken it exactly a prescribed and have never wanted or needed more than wa prescribed a a matter of fact i am currently taking mg two time per day but can take a much a mg five time per day
2652,xanax,too make a long story short a little over week ago after an mri we were told our daughter had a birth defect called chiari which required brain surgery which is scheduled for september my anxiety wa so bad i couldnt function normally and couldnt stop cry couldnt sleep had chest pain and my head wa so lightheaded i thought i would pas out xanax stopped all of it i only rate it an not because of how it work but because of me i still cant control my anxiety without help from xanax now i can sleep breath and only cry once a day if at all im seeing a shrink and feeling stronger so maybe soon i will be in control of myself again and handle my family life again a a strong mom and woman
2653,prozac,at first it made me feel really sick constantly and have stomach ache but after week it started to help me cope with my anxiety and depression waaay better i wan na make it clear i wasnt looking for a cure when i started taking prozac but just a way to better manage my feeling because i dont think i will ever be cured since ive been chronically depressed my whole life and it doe really help me manage way better i still have depressive episode tho but i dont break down cry easily or feel anxious all the time and i stopped disassociating
2654,fluoxetine,im pretty outgoing in naturebut id get depressed n aggressive from time to time anyway so the first week on this med wa very up and down i slept but woke up feeling tired i wa drowzy during the dayid feel good some day n worse on others i wa going to quit on my th weeki woke up n said i cant take this anymore but my mom convinced me to keep taking it it wa like a miracle i just woke up in the morningth week in n felt ok one morning energetic happy motivated could phone up anyone n talk wthout feeling like it wa torture so give it atleast week it should get even better than how im feeling now tht would be amazing
2655,alprazolam,i am a year old mother of and suffered from depression and very bad anxiety for year been in hospital time the longest month they filled me with all sort of medicine at some point i wa so out of it but then a new doctor i met gave me xanax along with some other antidepressant and i am doing fine and living a normal life i think these are great

2659,adderall xr,very bad mood swing
2660,xanax,very good for panic attack and relief of anxiety no known problem while on xanax however cutting down the dosage or frequency of use can cause increased anxiety and so it can cause dependency i have no prblems with xanax just problem when i dont have it
2661,fluoxetine,this medication wa a gamechanger for me ive suffered from anxietyocddepression my whole life and for the first time it feel like i can handle what life throw at me my anxiousintrusive thought still come but they no longer ruin daysweeksmonths i wa very nervous to start this medication because of review about sideeffects but i honesty believe that most people who come on these site to write review are the exception who have bad reaction the worst side effect i had wa losing a little weight while the best thing it did for me wa probably saving my life
2662,prozac,very good treatment option it wa my first ssri and i wa taking it for anxiety and other stress i couldnt handle a well a some therapy and coping mechanism this medicine is great i take mg and even that is enough to get rid of anxiety however it doe make you lose your sex drive and can make you completely lose interest in any sexual activity but all in out it a good treatment
2663,fluoxetine,taking mg fluoxetine for week mg bupropion month the st week wa rough experiencing many side effect but i felt more mentally and emotionally balanced within a couple of day and it ha only improved i experienced total appetite loss during the first couple week and consequently lost pound which wa a welcome side effect im not hypersensitive to rejection and criticism and feel more at ease interacting with others the negative thinking is still there but i can more easily counter those thought with rationale amp positivity i know it cliche to say but i feel like quotmequot again for the first time in year i give it because i still get frequent headache but the positive far outweighs the negative
2667,alprazolam,my face hand and foot get numb and i dont know what to do im in school and freak out im a hairdresser so i cant just stop and breath in a bag this medicine worked for me hope it work for you
2668,fluoxetine,i just started using prozac a couple of week ago and it ha been life changing i am a combat veteran who suffers from severe anxiety and sleeping problem and this drug ha completely abated those symptom my mood is much better i can concentrate for longer period of time and i dont have the social anxiety that wa plaguing me since i left the marine corp all in all this is a great drug that ha helped me move on from my anxiety i take mg per day minimum dose and that is working fine
2669,fluoxetine,i am a recovering opiate addict and alcoholic i have been sober for five year and extremely grateful however i have been diagnosed several time by physician a having depression it got so bad about a month ago that i decided to try prozac mg i have been on celexa in the past but it made feel disconnected the prozac took about three week to kick in but it is working wonderfully now for a few day it is like a switch wa flipped and i just feel normal and positive i do have some of the usual side effect but they are bearable everyone is different for sure but i am very pleased with prozac thus far if you are trying this medicine stick with it a it doe take a while to have an effect very grateful
2670,prozac,after suffering for some time with pmt i decided i couldnt continue the way i wa a it wa interfering with my personal life aswel a my work life i spoke to my gp who offered me some different option prozac being one of them at that point i felt i couldnt carry on the way i wa so gave prozac a try ive been on it for around week now and already feel normal again i dont feel anxious or hate myself it seems to have cleared my thought it still early but it definatly helped me get back to my old self
2673,adderall xr,first drug i started taking for add a month ago took the mg and it felt too intense and had a ton of side effect but after day wa tolerable but still suffered from really bad headache and dry mouth all day week later headache finally stopped but dry mouth wa horrible must have drank a gallon of water or more a day and had to have candy or gum all the time but i could tell i wa a little more productive at work at night i would catch myself daydreaming worse than before and wondered if i wa worse without it i felt it basically replaced my coffee and then some but the dry mouth wasnt worth it i am now going to start taking wellbutrin since i am a little depressed too and that drug is supposed to help with both
2674,xanax,i have had panic attack and anxiety since my teen appx year now when i wa younger the doctor prescribed mg xanax and it did nothing for me a a teenager i didnt take more than a few dosage over the year the panic attack have been become more severe and interfere with my health and life i decided to introduce xanax back into my life i have been taking it a needed for year it is not need everyday sometimes i take mg sometimes i might need mg for the entire day it ha saved my life i am currently working on biofeedback and cbt to better manage the ups and down i tried two ssri and let just say they made thing alot worse prozac wa awful xanax work with the right doctor and therapy you are not alone
2675,alprazolam,xanax xr mg every morning ha controlled my anxiety and panic attack since one of the ssri i tried worked zoloft but the side effect were unacceptable the xr doe not have those side effect and keep working at a constant dose though i occasionally need mg xanax prn cognitive behavioral psychotherapy and mindfulness meditation have helped too but they are not enough
2676,fluoxetine,life saver i feel that i wa possibly depressed for maybe a decade or le but soon after my father passed away about two year ago i hit rock bottom i wa extremely depressed i just couldnt function emotionally physically etc i would sleep all the time i just overall felt like life wa not exciting anymore and that i lost my sense of identity or having a purpose not only did my father passing cause me to become more depressed but lot of other major traumatic stressor hit me all at once too so i had and still have a lot going on but since i have been taking prozac only mg i am alive again and happy i just feel normal i dont cry anymore i feel amazing oh and no side effect at all just happiness
2678,fluoxetine,i have taken prozac for one year and three month it ha helped me a lot right now i am weaning myself off of this drug slowly but lately i have felt mild anxiety due to no sleeping and also mild stomach problem im not sure if it part of the withdrawal process
2679,prozac,i have taken prozac for one year and three month it ha helped me a lot right now i am weaning myself off of this drug slowly but lately i have felt mild anxiety due to no sleeping and also mild stomach problem im not sure if it part of the withdrawal process
2681,adderall,i wa prescribed this medicine when i wa a young child for adhd i took it all the way though my high school year until i decided i didnt need it i backed this theory by saying quotit made me feel funny and zone outquot i stopped taking it and since then i dropped out of school picked up a drug problem and have been in and out of jail i know i cant blame this on not taking medicine but i do know i didnt do any of that stuff when i wa taking it i wa a pretty good kid i recently got my and am going to be attending college in the fall i am actually trying to get back on this medicine so i can stay focused i am excited to see whats in store in the future but what i am really trying to say this drug work wonder

2686,fluoxetine,worked for about a month then i started sleeping hour a night and lost all motivation
2687,prozac,ive been on prozac now for a totally of four month ish i felt nothing for about two month and then one day i woke up and i felt like a different person i cleaned my bedroom got rid of half my thing did all the work that i wa supposed to do and i felt amazing i still feel like a new person now there is more balance i feel normal for the first time ever the first two month were tough i wa tired but couldnt sleep at night now im on an entirely normal sleep schedule more normal than ever i wa having some heart palpitation but that went away i do have rather vivid dream still and ive lost weight but i think thats just me feeling better about myself
2688,alprazolam,my doc started me on alprazolam about a year ago for but it wa anxiety that kept me awake i take one or two pill and i am able to fall asleep more easily i also take one pill during the day if i feel edgy i recognize early onset symptom because i had panic attack untreated for over yr i used alcohol for year until i realized the damage it did to my body i used pain pill for awhile stopped and then wa prescribed alprazolam
2689,alprazolam,i have suffered from anxiety amp panic attack since kindergarten i quotself medicatedquotwalcohol amp weed until they became an quotissuequotto say the least i hit rock bottom almost losing my family my jobtried aa shrink until i had a full blown thought i wa having a heart attack sweatingrapid heart beat etc i also dreaded any social affairsor change in my life i thought i wa just missing a linknot quotnormalquotwhatever that is i went to my dr amp he prescribed mg the lowest but i wa able to functionquot go to wedding not drink since im now on the mg addicted i am able to live wo alcohol amp function but do feel it if i dont take off maybebut it better than being a quotcaptivequot of my fear just be you
2691,alprazolam,i started this medicine about month ago for severe anxiety i tried everything they had out there for anxiety but nothing worked until now i still get a panic attack once in a while but something i can handle anxiety cause me to have heart disease and other problem health issue i recommend xanax xr
2692,xanax,i had panic attack in my entire life i went to a doctor and wa given xanax at half mg to take immediately and hr later it worked and i thought i would keep some handy for any possible future attack he prescribed mg pill time a day i looked it up on the internet and didnt like the information on addiction i went to my doctor when i got back home and he prescribed ativan i believe xanax should be used only when having a panic attack and not a a maintenance drug
2693,adderall,insurance didnt cover the extended release xr form so i wa taking multiple regular adderall pill a day it wa pretty obvious that they worked but over time i developed a tolerance that made me need to take one every hour rather than the standard only side effect wa foot so cold they tingled
2694,adderall xr,i wa diagnosed with add about year ago a year later i started taking a concerta for month it gave me headache and didnt help hearing good thing about adderall i tried it and wow it wa like magic i felt awesome i could actually think and focus and everything wa great with notsoterrible sideeffects the thing with adderall for me wa that i constantly had to change dos i tried xr and reg i jumped all over the spectrum because my biggest side effect wa it affected my sleep and i wa soon diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea may not be correlated but it exploited this problem after roughly year the sideeffects have increased and it doesnt help much looking into desoxyn and dexedrine
2696,fluoxetine,ive been taking fluoxetine for about month now i wa going through really bad depressionanxiety i tried celexa and other antidepressantcant remember the name but they made my depression worse i wa scared to try another one but i did anyways and im happy i did i can eat again sleep again function again it not a cure no antidepressant or antianxiety medicine is but it help to make it through the day the real work is all on you positive attitude balanced diet exercise and enough sleep this medicine may work for some but everybody is different pretty much trial and error
2697,alprazolam,xanax ha save my life it make life somewhat normal im and have been on it for severe panic disorder since the th grade when i wa hospitalized for panic disorder
2699,alprazolam,best medicine for my anxiety and help me to get quality sleep if i take one tablet im good for hour
2700,adderall xr,been on adderall xr for a week and i can tell a huge difference in my daily life i wa prescribed mg once a day i am year old and i believe i have always suffered from untreated adhd my only complaint is with no insurance it is a fairly expensive medication but so far well worth the cost
2701,prozac,im in my late s and have always had anxiety spike but in the last year my job ha become overwhelming to me and i would wake up vomiting and in anxiety attack i had always gone to therapist who would give me exercise which would work at first but after a while i could not handle it found a dr who gave me mg and i can not tell you how much it ha helped almost from the get go my spike have calmed down and i can control my feeling i havent really had any stress lately at work so i havent tested that out but just in my every day working where i would just feel anxiety it ha helped the one problem is that my sex drive is very low not gone but low
2702,alprazolam,ive never taken xanax before up until now ive tried effexor viibryd wellbutrin etc but none of those worked at all and i could not handle the side effect xanax ha given me my life back my panic attack have finally reduced but more importantly i can continue to function in my normal everyday life most other medicine have me sitting on the couch in the evening doing absolutely nothing a nothing seemed to matter with xanax i can effectively handle my overwhelming daily task list
2703,prozac,prozac wa the first medicine i tried for anxiety i tend to worry a lot and ob over thing i felt a decrease in my anxiety but it made me too lazy i didnt want to do anything except sit on the couch and watch tv i wa even too lazy to eat which caused me to lose weight i then tried lexapro which i gained weight on but felt a significant decrease in anxiety and now i am on cymbalta and do not feel a significant decrease in my anxiety and am thinking about talking to my doctor about trying something new again
2704,alprazolam,while i found this medication to be effective for anxiety the concentration amp memory loss were terrible and almost cost me my job i didnt really notice anything wa wrong until i started my new job training wa a nightmare i couldnt focus long enough to learn anything new i wa reading a short list of keywords and by the time i got to i couldnt remember i couldnt pay attention long enough to read a book or even a short article i couldnt remember people name i had to write everything down i couldnt focus on anything anyone wa telling me i would just pretend like i understood luckily i noticed something wa wrong and stopped taking it about month ago my memory and ability to focus have improved
2705,fluoxetine,i have been taking fluoxetine for about five month now it ha been a god send for me i am notoriously moody possibly from bpd and i do have obsessive compulsive disorder where i have repetitive thought and the only way i can describe prozac is that it feel like a vice grip on your brain that made you think about thing over and over release completely i feel so in control and wherever i put my focus it stay without drifting back i love this medication so much i will never leave it the only complaint i have is that it doe take forever to work forget about the to week rule it will take a few month and when it work you will feel so amazing for me mg is ideal
2706,fluoxetine,ive been on fluoxetine for about year or more now and i can tell you it ha been the best decision ive ever made i wa put on for ocd and depression a well a anxiety and the constant hand washing is a thing of the past when on it i feel like a happier person wanting to do more thing and have become more outgoing a like any medicine there are side effect at first but funnily enough i dont think i had any dont worry if you feel horrible when you first get on them you sometimes have to go down to come all the way back up
2708,alprazolam,it work wonder xanax ha made my life so much easier i am on mg x a day and i feel like im happier and more out going i dont know what i would do without it i give it star
2710,alprazolam,i suffer from severe depression and anxiety brought on by cancer and anti hormone drug this drug help me with the panic attack and anxiety i tend to get almost daily when i take this medication my attack are le severe
2711,fluoxetine,i wa on fluoxetine for depression and stress year ago for about a year i used to be tearful very unmotivated and stressed out by day to day thing i cant remember any side effect but can remember feeling calmer and happier all my problem were quotjust out of reachquot not stressing me out but could be dealt with a and when i wanted to i wa assaulted at work month ago i have for the past month struggled to come to term with it combined with self pressure to prove myself work wise and perceived pressure to quotbounce backquot from work i have ended up in a right old mess prescribed fluoxetine day ago i have had various side effect dizziness quotdisjointedquot feeling in my head but definitely calmer and le tearful
2712,prozac,i have been on prozac for almost a year although my dose ha been upped a couple of time i feel like i have my life back i know what quality of life is now
2713,amphetamine,yo college female keep me alert focused awake i usually wait a little bit after taking it to have caffeine not necessary just personal preference based on how it make me feel switched to it after taking vyvanse for almost a year which wa great but it eventually made me irritable so far i have loved this medication no side effect but if you take a dose too late in the day it will keep you up at night i take mg in the morning and then another dose when i really need to focus shorter release so i feel like i need a nap after hour overall would recommend
2714,adderall xr,i have used adderall xr for almost year for narcolepsy and find it to be most satisfactory i still fall asleep on occasion but feel the need ahead of time and can take a quick nap and wake fully refreshed adderall improved my libido but contributed to ed problem due to blood vessel constriction resulting in the need for daily cialis which keep everything in balance
2715,prozac,i had an eating disorder for almost a decade and prozac really stopped the thought and behavior
2717,xanax,a many people stated xanax ha given me my life back along side paxil when i had severe severe anxiety i took half a xanax daily but now that im thankfully a million time better i only take it once in a blue moon when i feel like i need it and take a quarter of a pill this is amazing
2718,xanax,this medication is great for anxiety and panic attack when used correctly make sure you dont abuse it or mix with any downer it say it used for short treatment but it can if monitor correctly be used for long term if your doctor physician or psychiatrist think it right for you im very thankful for this medication for it ha work wonderfully on reducing anxiety and take away my panic attack this is my opinion
2719,adderall xr,this drug provides great concentration for a couple hour however after a couple hour i predictably experience extreme anxiety depression and irritability it can easily cause you to get into an argument with someone you love because you are so easily irritated and frustrated by anything the anxiety is the worst being a previous smoker adderall increase my craving to smoke by ten fold a habit i have quit and hardly have craving for anymore i also find that the drug cloud my ability to think when doing brain intensive work such a programming math or even typing i think that might be related to the dosage though i dont recommend this medication to anyone other than those with severe adhd
2721,alprazolam,the only medication that stop my paralyzing panic attack generally work within minute side effect are nonexistent
2723,alprazolam,ive always suffer with anxiety but ive been able to control it ive been out of work for week with a phobia of going back because i had a panic attack amp i wa exposed and people were watching my secret wa out rewind week ago i had a kidney infection i wa in the hospital for day home for day then went directly back to a stressful job thats where it happened the attack people were surrounding me and causing me more stress i wa put back in the hospital im now on buspar and xanax buspar i have my negative thought on that not sure it helping or not dizzy spell but the xanax doe help with the anxiety it make me super sleepy and groggy im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist pray me
2724,alprazolam,xanax saved me apprehensive about taking med but broke down after it got so bad i didnt even want to take the cover off my head with my eye clenched shut just fearing every day because i knew anxiety fear of everything under the sun and panic attack would rule my day i wa told i needed to be on long term anxiety drug so i tried lexapro and ended up in the er with side effect so horrific i dont even want to think of it now xanax is basically a quick fix to calm the anxiety but it the only thing im willing to take and over time i broke out of the nightmare i wa living i still have bout of anxiety but a long a i have xanax on hand i know ill be ok i never had any bad side effect except for being tired trade is worth it
2727,adderall xr,i suffer from a fairly severe case of adhd and take mg adderall xr daily having been on this medication for quite a few year now and taking an almost month break from adderall ive gained a better understanding of myself both on and off the drug adderall give me a balance in every sense of the word it help me regulate my emotion give me the focus i lack and allows me to feel whole inside i also feel that it help me with connecting to others with impulsivity a a main symptom of my adhd and one that get me in a lot of trouble adderall help me to be more mindful when i am communicating myself to the people that i care about aside from the mild appetite suppression this drug really doe wonder for people like me
2728,xanax,i have had anxiety since i wa a child from my personal experience this medicine is the fastest and effective but be very careful also the most depending i ran my prescription short one month and wa without for a couple of day and had a seizure while driving just because the doctor say three or four time a day doesnt mean you need them that much be very careful
2729,xanax,life saver for me but only because i take it when i truly need it i suffer from day to day anxiety but i do not take it for that i try to get rid of anxiety other natural way but i do suffer from severe panic attack especially night time so i only take it when i am having an attack i am on the lowest dose possible and i can get away with taking even just half of that sometimes it take the edge off very fast and i feel so much better shortly after take it on average time a month sometime le rarely more extremely addictive med so i urge you to stay away from it for daily use or if you have an addictive personality
2730,adderall,i wa diagnosed with narcolepsy they started me on ritalin which did not work for me then dexedrine it did work but caused a lot of tension in neck shoulder back in the evening then provigil nuvigil i have settled on adderall it wake me in the morning and keep me awake in the afternoon it a god send
2731,adderall,i have been taking adderall for now month this medication ha completely changed my life it is one of the most effective smart drug out there adderall improves concentration and ability to focus on your work i suffer from narcolepsy i take mg adderall after a weak it work very well i have personal experience with the adderall is absolutely great for me
2732,prozac,prozac wa the first antidepressant i wa ever put on and it never really helped me i couldnt eat normally for several week kept throwing up and while waiting for the side effect to go away my doctor gave me a higher dose and my anxiety seemed to get even worse about a month in my suicidal thought got worse and i just got reckless with my life because i felt like nothing mattered after an intervention with my friend i decided to just stop taking it cold turkey and i really didnt experience that bad of withdrawal effect i wa just glad i wasnt taking it anymore i would say it made me the most suicidal id been in a long time and while it may work wonder for some people it just did not work with me
2734,fluoxetine,i suffer from chronic anxiety with periodic bout of mild depression for year i tried everythingacupuncture diet exercise and htp had a horrible experience with zoloft and paxil when i developed depression in college i tried antidepressant for month but with horrible side effect a a result i avoided medication to address my anxiety and or mild depression through the year unfortunately my anxiety level became unbearable this past year i tried the following lexapro mg absolutely horrible made me extremely tired depressed and never reduced my anxiety level xanax extremely helpful but still experienced agitation stress irritability and anxiousness prozac mg a life changer i feel relaxed
2735,xanax,i have had horrible panic attack out of nowhere since i wa in elementary school i got on xanax when i wa year old and still take it today it ha been a god send and i have tried cognitivebehavioral therapy counseling ssri other benzodiazepine etc and this ha been the medication that ha helped the most i have gotten my anxiety under control and only take it a needed
2736,alprazolam,i used to get very aggravated over what normal people handle i would go off have panic attack and not know how to deal plus i have tremor in my hand mostly my right once i started taking xanax the tremor stopped i could deal calmly with my child when they got out of control it help me concentrate easier during the day amp sleep well nite it can have side affect though if you dont take it properly take it a prescribed and dont make yourself go through the withdrawal
2738,fluoxetine,prozac is a wonderful medicine i started on it year ago and took it for about month and stopped because i wa feeling great depression returned and i am on it again i felt difference in a few hour after taking the first pill prozac made me feel like a happy person again all my worry and obsessive thought faded away they are there in the back of my head but they are only a thought nothing to worry about every minute of my life it work great for me
2740,prozac,i have taken prozac for about fifteen year no more cyclical valley of depression followed by high capable of handling extreme stress exercising weekly sex reduced libido my weight ha stayed the same the two to three time of exercising a week is all it take to be healthy only downside is acting out dream time a year and kicking leg while sleeping the dream i cant predict the kicking leg can be sensed in early evening and i just take two liquid advil to subdue them life is good
2741,fluoxetine,did not work for my anxiety and made it difficult to maintain an erection
2744,alprazolam,i have to start by saying that im fearful of medication for starter secondly i have dealt with anxiety panic attack and agoraphobia for many year now im not housebound but do have a small neighborhood radius of quotcomfortquot i have in the past felt shamed of my condition a i thought i wa unique and alone and somewhat embarrassed to try to explain my irrational feeling and thought which i have learned since that they are entirely quotmade upquot and thought lead to feeling that lead to behavior all of which can be undone with the help of medicine therapy relaxation technique journaling diet exercise and not being afraid to open up about your anxiety you are not alone learn to relax it work
2745,alprazolam,i have been on ssri and benzos for probably or year ssri for depression and on top of that benzos for anxiety and panic attack wa on ativan for year and it eventually stopped working would take mg pill and it would not affect my anxiety at all psychiatrist switched me to xanax mg everyday a needed up to pill a day it actually work it take a few minute and wipe away any panic attack and softens my anxiety i am very careful though because i know it can be very addictive i wa clean off the ativan for month and had no withdrawls so i know i wa not addicted to that have only been on the xanax a few month and i only take it a needed so not to get addicted
2746,niravam,this is the only medication that make me able to focus and stop obsessing on thing i cant control and make me able to be productive and active

2748,xanax,xanax ha helped me so much with handling all of life problem and with helping me with my child i have two boy that mean the world to me i lost my job after year and everything got on my nerve i went to my doctor and told him i wa trying to sleep alot cause i could not handle lossing my job and worrying about how i wa gon na pay my bill if i couldnt draw my employment i would know that in daysso i went on xanax and it changed my life i now know ill make it no matter what just try it
2749,fluoxetine,i wa prescribed prozac last year for depression and ocd the first three day taking it were hard for me my depression worsened and i wa having terrifying nightmare every night i went back to my doctor explained to him how i wa feeling and i wa immediately taken off and switched to something else everyone reacts differently to different medication but make sure you tell your doctor if your depression worsens or you feel more anxious or have nightmare the nightmare every single night wa what made my doctor know that prozac wasnt for me even if it supposed to take week or however many to kick in make sure you tell your doctor youre not feeling well let them decide what the best decision is for you
2755,prozac,i have been on fluoxetine for le than a month and it going ok during the first week i felt surprising amazing i had a new love of life the week after i felt suicidal i felt worse and i just wanted to stay in bed and never leave i feel constantly nauseous which isnt good this week i have felt a little calmer i feel normal i hope i stay like this and just level out
2757,adderall xr,diagnosed yr ago participated in strattera study did not help at all finally started adderall mg xr two day ago main difference is the absence of fatigue and quieted mind i can actually sit and not have to argue with myself overwhelming feeling gone for the most part insomnia straight away first night hardly any sleep again last nd night underlying headache now definite loss of appetite appreciate the lost lb but still have to eat
2758,adderall,i wa diagnosed with and ive been using adderall for just over year now my th year of school i finished with a very low gpa just over a and finished most of my class with either f or d but this past year that i wa able to get my medicine i wa awarded ab honorle and passing every class with an a except b the mass improvement of my ability to focus and actually want to work actually made the principal think i wa cheating since ive had such a bad school record for grade
2760,fluoxetine,this ha literally changed my life i wa depressed angry anxious and didnt like myself very much i could not stop my angry comment or pick myself up except for the child now i feel like i did year ago happy grateful for my lovely husband enjoying socialising again i wish i had taken it year ago
2761,adderall,i have been on adderall mg for month i am year old i wa sleeping hr a day and when awake i wa lethargic and had a compulsion sleep i also have severe chronic pain refractory depression and panic disorder so with so many problem i could hardly do a thing adderall wa ideal because it helped treat my narcolepsy it reduced the sedation from the opioids i take it actually treat pain when added to opioids it helped my depression which did not respond to over drug and feeling better i stared to conquer my agoraphobia it cant say it is a quotcurequot because i still struggle i can still fall asleep even when talking to a friend only problem wa a little bruxism when i started and when the dose went up
2764,fluoxetine,wa on mg for yr not much change switched to mg for two week then doctor bumped it up to mgday i think it might help depression but i feel it doing very little to help anxiety dont like the idea of having to be dependent on medicine to make me feel normal stick with it awhile longer
2765,alprazolam,i have been on xanax since when i wa watching my mother slowly suffer i started on mg and eventually the dose wa not enough now ordered mg in morning and mg at night it work however i have cognitive impairment and all i want to do is sleep and my memory is pretty shot i weaned myself down very very slowly and got down to mg daily at night but then some negative event happened and i wa going into a panic attack i know this medication work but i would not take it unless it is a must
2766,alprazolam,please try a different benzo before this drug it a life ruiner the effect are so strong and leave the body quickly it make you crave more tolerance build like crazy with this drug too i suggest klonopin it work great and last a lot longer withdrawal is horrible from xanax you can die from it also come with severe memory loss while taking it
2767,alprazolam,very good for panic attack and relief of anxiety no known problem while on xanax however cutting down the dosage or frequency of use can cause increased anxiety and so it can cause dependency i have no prblems with xanax just problem when i dont have it
2769,fluoxetine,where do i beginwow this medicine ha really given me my life back i truly felt like i wa loosing my mind before i started taking this i am in my late s and for the past couple year i have tried several other medication for my severe mood swing pm being a mother of with a husband and working a a full time critical care nurse i needed my life back my doctor said she had been going back to the quotold faithfulquot prozac for a lot of her patient and boy am i glad i finally tried this one i havent had any of the crazy side effect i wa scared of and i feel calmer happier and not so socially awkward im only on mg but i feel wonderful with this
2770,alprazolam,this medicine xanax work effectively and quickly to resolve anxiety and panic attack however i found that after i went on the antidepressant pristiq the xanax made me fall asleep i had to switch off of the xanax a it wa too sedating at this point i have another benzodiazepine that i can use if i have to but pristiq ha been keeping most of my panic attack away
2772,adderall,im a fulltime college student in my mids ive been on adderall for month now i cut my mg ir in half and take it in the morning and the other half hour later and another half after hour if needed i dont take it everyday i probably only take it x a week if you dont have an addictive personality you wont be addicted to it i have to say it work really well with my add im able to study for hour at a time i dont necessarily think it make you smarter it just let you focus on a task without getting distracted i think my only complaint is sudden mood swing and agitation i definitely noticed a difference in my personality the day im not on it i get angry very easily and irritable
2774,fluoxetine,i starting on sertraline year ago and felt that my body had got used to it and wasnt getting any effect after a year my gp then put me on fluoxetine mg to start it took about week to really begin to feel calmer and le sensitive to daily stress and i had an amazing sleep but the effect began to wear off after a year my gp then increased my dose to mg a i wa going through a really stressful time at work and couldnt cope thankfully work ha been better and ive changed my role but ive started to feel really depressed and have been having suicidal thought which i never used to have i have really vivid dream and im starting to get home from work take the dog out make dinner and once all my chore are done then i g
2775,fluoxetine,i have never had thought about suicide until i took prozac this wa the absolute scariest experience of my life
2776,fluoxetine,i had mild ocd mdd stress anxiety since childhood due to bad environment then i went on venlafaxine nortriptyline when i wa on it i did some terrible thing like stealing without fear of getting caught violent behavior mind going blank forgetfulness apathy sexual dysfunction after month i start to feel better mood wise
2777,mydayis,i wanted this medication to work because i often forget to take my second generic adderral dose on time however mydayis is not the wonder drug i wanted it to be it take up to hour to kick in something they hide in the fact and even though i quotworkedquot this drawback by waking up earlier to take it there wasnt enough positive to keep me taking it past week four it lasted about hour before it quickly declined and leaving me with even worse add symptom it wa so bad i couldnt have a conversation or focus enough to make dinner without skipping into laundry cleaning or some other distraction without the use of any medication i have never had symptom this bad if this wasnt bad enough i had horrible nausea and indigestion
2778,prozac,i wa reluctant to begin fluoxetine because id had a terrible experience when my gp started me on mg of sertraline eventually i ended up going private and the psych prescribed me prozac but starting on a really low dose of mg for a week then mg for week and now mg for the last month it been great really cut down my intrusive thought to basically nothing concentration is better im enjoying life again this is also due to a good therapist but the medication ha definitely helped main side effect wa sleepiness but having suffered with insomnia on and off for year it been great not dreading bedtime anymore in the first couple of week of a new dose id have a bit of brain fog but other than that it been great
2780,prozac,so im on mg taken in the morning to treat ptsd and ocd intrusive thought im on mg taken in the morning im on my th day today i woke up feeling extremely anxious border of a panic attack so i took half of a lorazepam to take the edge off i do notice that at time my intrusive thought and normal one just race going back and forth but physically i am calm im not breaking down a easily which i have noticed improvement this is why im hanging in there and giving this a chance i do notice something that ha heightened and that would be my urge to run and be outside it all fed by my anxiety thats why i dont let it bother me much i have noticed that i am walking outdoors more often
2781,xanax,i wa taking mg of xanax almost daily for about a year i tried to quit cold turkey by being off of them for about day straight and when day hit me i thought i wa going to die i couldnt sleep for the day i didnt have it constant pacing around the house twitch like crazy and had to get some asap a i wa out it ha been over a month now and i am slowly coming off of the xanax i am down to about mg every day or so and i havent had any additional medication it can be done but you have to prepare yourself for it mentally and tell yourself you can do it i have quit in the past and regret ever picking up the bottle again
2782,prozac,prozac saved me ive been in and out of hospital for year wa diagnosed with major depressive disorder after changing doctor and medicine i finally feel like myself again i here no voice of worry and stress im not irritated over the slightest thing i can now think clearer after month of depression and panic attracts my new doctor recommended prozac for week i felt nausea and weakness then on the third week i got up and out and got a job the same day i wa no longer stuttering and confused my relationship with my significant other is better my thought were very clear id finally gained my confidence back im very happy i tried prozac i feel amazing
2783,alprazolam,hey i think alprazolam is the only solution for severe anxiety my life wa a living hell before it eventually it came to be the saving factor in my relationship thanks
2784,alprazolam,xanax is a miracle just recently prescribed xanax and lexapro at age for generalized anxiety disorder and i can honestly say that i am back to my old self i have only had panic attack in the last month i can sleep all night without waking up i am much more laid back i am calm and not worrying all the time i would definitely talk to your md about both of these medicine if you truly have an anxiety disorder both have been a life saver for me and my family
2785,alprazolam,xanax ha been a life saver for me i have been diagnosed with panic disorder and depression since i wa a teenager i learned through lot of therapy that my issue are environmental and chemical there are time when meditating and positive affirmation do not work during my attack this is when i take my xanax so i can function like a normal human being i do not abuse my xanax and have been on the same dose mg for the last year there wa a time that i wa having multiple panic attack daily for month xanax helped me stay sane until my psychiatric found the right ssri for me i think that this drug is great a long a you have a good doctor and use the appropriate amount
2787,alprazolam,i started taking xanax in after having a heart catheter that went wrong i went into v tach after that i suffered from arrhythmia daily and panic attack ending up in the hospital a few time first the arrhythmia start which brings on panic attack i realize now this is all ptsd my new internist put me on xanax at mg which had little result then upped to mg which i take one twice a day year later im still on it taking same dosage tried going off a few time unsuccessfully new doctor lowered it to one day hoping for the best
2788,xanax,i have suffered from severe panic attack for year xanax is the only medicine that ha helped me i dont take it time daily a prescribed i take it only when i have a panic attack it work wonder
2789,xanax,i wa prescribed xanax by my psychiatrist because of severe anxiety i wa started on mg to be taken at night it ha been the best medication prescribed for my condition a it also helped slow down the suicidal thought which were on a daily basis i am still taking xanax under gp supervision a it help relieve the level of anxiety tremendously it is the best medication ever made for people who are born prone to anxiety throughout their childhoodadolescence and extreme shyness yes shyness i also take it in conjunction with antidepressant aropax which helped with my depression but also with my unfortunate disability of extreme shyness which wa a constant problem for me a an adult basically all my life
2791,alprazolam,im year old and this medication gave me my life back i have social anxiety hypochondria and occasional panic attack id immediately become stiff and uptight at all social event a well a at school it got so bad that it affected my grade after i take a xanax the anxiety simply vanishes and it replenished with relaxation tranquility and stability all the scary racing thought stop and i begin to think more logically and calmly i take mg five time a day a needed xanax is also wonderful for muscle spasm
2792,alprazolam,i recently realized i have had anxiety practically my whole life being thirty year old now i really wish i had been prescribed this a long time ago it ha reduced my shaking and anxiety effect so much that i feel like a real person i never knew what it wa like to feel calm until now i am very thankful for this medicine
2793,alprazolam,insomnia i only use this at night about twice a week and alternate with ambien this work great i have tried every natural herb there is and absolutely nothing work apart from ambien and alprazolam no side effect and i feel great in the morning never need it during the day
2795,fluoxetine,start taking for depression a couple of week ago side effect is i have not had any compulsion to binge or purge for the last week amazing after year of bulimia
2797,fluoxetine,ive only just started taking fluoxetine but i wanted to comment that i have no side effect i have tried zoloft and with those side effect i thought i wa going to die i wa so scared to try something new but no side effect for me
2798,alprazolam,xanax ha really helped me with my anxiety and it not habit forming to me it help me a lot
2799,fluoxetine,personal experience put up with the initial uncomfortable feeling of dizziness increased anxiety insomnia lethargy the anxiety is usually your fear related to taking medicine and the what ifs medicine alone can not make you think bad thing after week yes i wa one of the unlucky few who had very bad side effect for all that time but i stuck with it the therapeutic effect start coming through eventually dont just assume medicine will make you completely happy you still need to actively change your life to fix the root cause of anxiety or depression do mediation quit drinking do cbt take up exercise see a therapist be around people more
2801,mydayis,not at all what i expected have used vyvanse with success but went back to adderall more flexibility dosing can take a second dose during the day if necessary or not mydayis take an unusually long time to kick in have found that i am much more irritable foggy and have experienced feeling of being overwhelmed at work doing thing that i normally handle day in and day out with no problem i am for the most part easy going everything seems to annoy me since i began using mydayis also have experienced headache during lag time body ache and flu like symptom a lot of the time i feel worse than i do unmedicated do not like mydayis at all will not be refilling
2802,prozac,id struggled with bulimia and depression for many year i wa prescribed prozac to mainly treat my depression and partly the eating disorder with my personal experience with bulimia i never had the urge to binge eat just to make myself vomit after eating proper sized portion of food i had found that the prozac had helped stopped the urge to throw up after eating quite effectively the only side effect being that once i had stopped taking it the urge returned immediately currently and trying to battle those thought without being prescribed medication but may go back onto it if im unsuccessful after a year or so
2803,adderall,while adderall definitely helped my add symptom the comedown wa absolutely horrible i wa on mg per day mg ir in morning mg ir hr later it made me finally able to focus and stay organized for the month i took it however a soon a it started wearing off i turned into a real big jerk and i even lost some friend because of it i eventually discontinued it after having a mental breakdown and due to several of my closest friend and family approaching me about how i wa acting i ended up switching to concerta and currently take mg per day i find that it work time better than adderall did for me long story short adderall while definitely very effective at treating my symptom wasnt the right fit for me
2805,adderall,ive tried straterra dexedrine ritalin vyvanse i would take vyvanse but it way too generic adderall ha been the best a far a cost and effect the only thing i have disliked is the connotation adderall ha because i can tell some doctor are against it i have had two doctor lecture me on how something else must be wrong because i take mg daily i tried to switch to the xr and lower my dose to mg but insurance wont cover it this medication ha been really helpful for me but i feel like i need it because without it im a wild ape hyper make silly noise annoying it keep me calm and focused on the big picture i would use modafilin if i could because the side effect are le pronounced but again the price
2806,xanax,i have been on xanax for about year now i have suffered with anxiety since i wa a child and depression later in life i started out only taking mg a day even going for period of time without taking it at all and then over the past year i have graduated to only mg a day i feel no need for an increase i suffer with all the usual anxiety symptom but one symptom that is most annoying is the choking sensation i feel in my throat i believe i carry my stress and worry there when i take xanax it take this terrible feeling away i find it extremely difficult to get a doctor to prescribe me this medicine a i moved to another state the people who abuse this drug make it extremely difficult for those of u who need it
2808,adderall xr,i have mdd gad and adhd the worse trifecta in my opinion the reason why is because when i start treating one disorder the others get worse well i had gotten my mdd and gad in check and on to treat my adhd so i wa given a very low dose of adderall xr mg it wa way too over stimulating for me i had so much anxiety that i couldnt even focus which is what adderall is supposed to help you do so i switched over to mg adderall xr and while my anxiety didnt shoot up like the last dosage it still wa ineffective
2809,fluoxetine,i have depression prozac did not help me after week and several side effect the only positive experience wa the fact that i didnt feel anything quotbadquot or quotgoodquot the worst wa the major lack of motivation and loss of all interest in what i enjoyed in life that wa kind of the problem before the medicine this is my second day off prozac and i feel better each day good luck all
2810,fluoxetine,i am a male early s i suffer from major depression anxiety and occasional panic i started prozac mg and now in my th week of treatment the first week i felt no relief suffered from side effect such a fatigue anxiety and disrupted sleep pattern beginning of the rd week i began to feel a noticeable difference my thought became le negative i just felt le depressedanxious than usual and side effect have almost gone away then into my rdth week i began to feel better and better each day it seems much more gradual than other antidepressant now into my th week i do feel much better however it is still early for me and i have had set back caused by excessive alcoholmarijuana use overall stick with it
2811,adderall,great medication i wa doing task again and talking to people again the only down side is i want something more hr the instant release tab had peak and after the peak i would have massive anxiety and the same wa with the extended release it a great medicine but not for me
2812,fluoxetine,i started prozac mg friday it been day i feel weak tired anxious depressed and my appetite is out of control eating all the time i am going to give this more time hopefully it work for me like it ha for all the others on here i would give anything to not feel this way anymore ive struggled with it my whole life
2813,alprazolam,this pill work miracle for me it is completely effective against all of my anxiety it also make me feel le ocd i no longer ob over thought or worry while i am on this xanax unleashes my creativity i play guitar write music and draw a lot i used to do all these thing but have thought i lost interest because i had no inspiration i have no side effect except some memory loss and tiredness i wish my doctor would up my prescription i am on mg a day and for the past nine month i have always finished my prescription in week but this doe well for keeping tolerance low and avoiding addiction and dependence i am on it for week and then off until my refill
2814,fluoxetine,i can honestly say i like it because it kept me well balanced i have child so i wa afraid that i wouldnt be able to function properly a a parent but it worked out really well on the plus side i hardly felt any side effect
2815,prozac,i have been on several different ssri before and havent seen much improvement so far this seems to be the only antidepressant thats worked for me and hasnt given me too many side effect i wa on luvox which wasnt helping at all for any of the multiple condition it wa prescribed to treat and wa switched to an equivalent dose of prozac ever since starting it ive had more energy and have been able to smile laugh and overall just feel like a normal person for me in combination with seroquel adderall for adhd but also give what i take for depression a little boost and wellbutrin this is a wonder drug it still help me get through every day after quite a few month on it couldnt say the same about other ssri
2816,alprazolam,i had the worst anxiety imaginable that manifested to agoraphobia and i wa a prisoner for year it a long story but xanax saved my life or rather gave me my life back in any event those that suffer daily anxiety or gad general anxiety disorder are better off using an moa inhibitor a a maintenance medication and xanax a an emergency medication im on effexor daily mg that took about week to start working but when it did is too wa a miracle i did have side effect when i started but my doctor told me to quothang in therequot because the side effect are usually just temporary and they were with the exception of weight gain in which i control with exercise and diet which gave me another side effect better health
2817,xanax xr,xanax xr mg every morning ha controlled my anxiety and panic attack since one of the ssri i tried worked zoloft but the side effect were unacceptable the xr doe not have those side effect and keep working at a constant dose though i occasionally need mg xanax prn cognitive behavioral psychotherapy and mindfulness meditation have helped too but they are not enough
2818,adderall,i love adderall it the best it give great energy and doesnt let you get tired also you dont feel the urge to eat everything when you are sad
2819,adderall,i do not like taking medicine but had extreme anxiety and trouble paying attention before i wish i took this before been a few day and more so much more focused i havent misplaced phone or car key
2821,prozac,took this a i wa having bad anxiety and insomnia waking up early constantly with that uncomfortable tight chest feeling and just having no energy seemed to work for the first day then i got really depressed i started at mg and went up mg a week til i hit mg i have been super depressed more anxious wa extremely nauseous and could barely eat for almost week and my sleep hasnt improved at all after almost week on this stuff i am a mess and dont feel like myself at all weening off and trying something else i got up to mg tried to get to but just felt too horrible
2822,fluoxetine,prozac ha saved my life i wa unable to function normally and wa very irritable i have been taking it for month and it is amazing other than not feeling hungry and feeling numb to thing that formerly made me irate i have had no bad side effect i am finally living only wish i had the nerve to take it year ago i missed out on so much due to my severe depression
2823,fluoxetine,after having tried everything available naturaldiethormonal fluoxetine is the only thing that combat my severe pm downside is complete lack of sex drive and blunted emotion going to try to reduce from mg every day to week before period
2824,adderall,adderall is amazing it really work ive never really been one to take medicine even tylenol but this drug ha changed my life old me wa cranky according to my wife
2825,alprazolam,i started taking xanax over ten year ago for my anxiety i started with mg twice a day and ended up at mg every hour and still felling like i needed more a i wa addicted i had one heck of a time weaning off i now take of a mg tablet every to hour when needed for my tinnitus it work to lessen the anxiety caused by the constant ringing in my ear and i try some day to take it only once or twice it ha worked great for me but i suggest being very conservative with your dosing because it is very easy to build a tolerance and form an addiction
2827,fluoxetine,just wanted to share my experience woke up in the middle of the night week ago with a massive panic attack that i thought wa a heart attack went to the er two night in a row because they just wouldnt stop saw my doctor the next day and wa diagnosed with general anxiety and panic disorder wa prescribed mg prozac fluoxetine first week wa horrible almost all my symptom increased couldnt eat lost my sex drive it now a week in and i cant even tell you how much better i feel everything is back to normal eating like crazy sex drive is back this drug is a miracle it will probably worsen your symptom at first but think of it a an investment and keep pushing through and you should feel better hope this help anyone
2828,fluoxetine,i have been off prozac for about week nowafter starting year ago for a terrible depressionsadnessmenopause wanted to take a holiday to see what would happen when on prozac side effect like decrease sexual drive and slight weight gain otherwise it put my menopause symptom in control decrease my hot flash helped my sadness and gave relief for some mild ocd that i have had for year now when i am off the medicine i notice and increase in my ocd behavior not concentrating a well at work sexual appetite is still not that great despite a wonderful patient husband could still just be the menopause hot flash have not really returned and i do not feel overwhelmingly sad i will start prozac tomorrow and see if it help with ocd

2853,alprazolam,stay away from xanax please it will help you in the moment but literally hour later the rebound anxiety and insomnia will hit you and make you regret taking it at all in the first place and before you know it youll go from half a bar to multiple bar just to sleep at night oh and the increased despersonalizion and dark thought are not potential quotside effectsquot they are some of the many very real consistently direct effect of taking xanax benzos should be used a rarely and a shortterm a possible even in these case the withdrawal is very realit hurt just to live please take my word for it im going through it for the tenth time right now addictive
2855,adderall,i have used this medication for over three year with great success in combating lifelong inability to maintain focus or to complete task get to work on time etc etc recently my physician informed me that the manufacturer of adderall had quit making immediate release tablet wa taking mgday and switched me over to vyvanse mg time released now im having problem sleeping feel generally depressed doubt they quit making adderallas my doctor saidand think it is more likely the authority wa coming down

2860,fluoxetine,i am me again my premenstual dysphoric disorder wa destroying my relationship with others and with myself for a week to two week a month i had severe depression anxiety suicidal thought and interpreted others action a hostile i would feel at time like breaking up with my boyfriend leaving my family and job and saying f u to life this is the second time i have taken fluoxetine over long period of time last time i stopped cold turkey many year ago thinking i wa cured of my pdd however over the year it worsened until i lived in fear of it now i really see understand and feel grateful for the effect of fluox i feel i am clear in control calm and me again it ha improved my relationship with everyone the side effect breast growth win
2861,alprazolam,very good a little drowsiness after panic subsides though im not sure if this is due to a physiological response to subsiding high level of hormone associated with fightflight response cortisol and adrenaline involved in panic attack
2863,prozac,had panic attack for year until started on prozac stopped after two week made a wonderful difference in my anxiety and depression
2864,fluoxetine,i have been on these since and since january this year i came off them i feel terrible and have noticed i do need them and they do work wonder
2865,xanax,xanax ha been a life saver i have always had problem feeling a little anxious but once i wa diagnosed a having a brain tumor at it only made thing worse my doctor prescribed lexapro which worked okay but i didnt like the way it made me feel so i stopped taking them on my own one particular night about week ago i got so upset that i thought i wa having a heart attack i wa dizzy chest hurting and pounding weakness nobody could find anything medically wrong with me i asked the doctor for something for anxiety to which he prescribed xanax mg every hour and within the minute of taking it all my symptom had diminished xanax really saved my life
2866,prozac,i suffered horribly with post partum depression and severe anxiety for year after the birth felt so terrible all the time felt like i couldnt do anything everything overwhelmed me tried prozac and didnt notice a difference for week then slowly started feeling calmer and could somewhat focus on task and errand i started supplement vitamin d and fish oil felt more relief with this combination of prozac and supplement noticed a lift of mood and sleep wa once again welcomed instead of torture i had severe insomnia during my depression all i can say is ive been on this combination for almost year and felt much better my heart go out to anyone suffering from this illness
2867,prozac,hi everyone i experienced extreme anxiety which then lead to panic disorder it sound like it basically started from built up stress but let me tell you my story a i want people to feel more comfortable and understand whats going on a i have done extensive research on the issue first anxiety and panic disorder are awful you feel like you cant breathe that youre having a heart attack you get dizzy you feel off balance you get sweaty hand and foot youre not comfortable and always anxious sometimes you even feel that youre leg are going to give out if the above feel like you well i took prozac and honestly it saved me
2868,fluoxetine,after about month or so all of the side effect that i wa having disappeared it work great for my pm anxiety and even help me to think clearer add just be patient one thing that i dont like is the weight gain but plump and happy is better than thin and cranky
2869,fluoxetine,ive been on fluoxetine mg for only day i have noticed some change already i have the worst anxiety and for the past day stressful situation seem a tad bit le stressful for me i already lost pound on it it make me never think about food anymore it make me not hungry for hour even a small granola bar can keep me satisfied and full for hour but i force myself to have breakfast lunch and dinner thing seem more brighter color are more vivid to me overall i think it starting to work i will rerespond in a few week to touch base
2870,prozac,i wa put on prozac mg for severe ocd and anxiety year ago and took it for a little bit over a year and it helped tremendously i wa dumb and stopped taking it and over the course of month my ocd and anxiety slowly got worse to the point where i had been when i first started taking the medicine i just started back up on it about week ago and the first week on it wa bad for me i had lot of anxiety and suicidal thought but here recently im starting to notice some improvement in my anxiety dont stop taking prozac just because you feel better i found out the hard way and it not worth it
2872,adderall,ive had a wonderful experience with adderall it help me focus and get up to do the daily thing that need to be done plus more
2873,fluoxetine,at age forty i started screaming at my kid and my husband wa so irritating during my cycle i can laughingly say i wanted to kill people because i know i wouldnt ever hurt anyone but man i started screaming my head off at my family so bad in fact that i started locking myself in my bedroom during quotthat time quot for day my doctor prescribed fluoxetine mg by mouth every day for day before the onset of my period i no longer scream at my kid or feel like strangling my husband yaaay been about month no side effect that ive noticed
2875,alprazolam,i have lived with anxiety for five year and it ha been a living nightmare i struggle with trying to relax and calm after a long day work i am a mother fulltime employee and a recent college graduate fulltime too i have lived so long being stretched and now that i dont need to stretch that far i have issue with trying to relax and take it easy i am on celexa and had to add xanax to my regimen a year ago after having my first panic attack i take mg a needed and sometimes before bed to help me sleep xanax ha helped me calm my nerve and relax usually within the first half hour i feel like i can chill out it take away the physical effect shakiness and fast heart beat and cool the mind and thought process
2876,alprazolam,i truly believe that xanax ha been the only medication that ha worked for my anxiety and depressionany other anxietydepression prescription that i have been on never really worked i would be shaky a lot tired all the time and i never just felt sane or content i have been prescribed zoloft paxil and even abilify but none of those worked xanax is what worked for me and it calm me down every time i need it and that is a lot because i am easily upset and can easily become stressed out this is a miracle medicine it really is
2877,alprazolam,i took clonazepam instead of xanax but they are in the same family i found it greatly helped my tinnitus i wa ready to lose my mind when i first got tinnitus from a virus in my inner ear year ago i swear clonazepam saved my life a i wa struggling with the idea of living with tinnitus forever anyone considering it should be aware that benzos are addictive and can have longterm negative side effect i didnt realize it at the time im now tapering off clonazepam a i hope to be able to handle the tinnitus with meditation effexor antidepressant and antianxiety drug and a stubborn will i do not regret using clonazepam for year but be aware going off it can be difficult most doctor arent aware it help tinnitus
2880,prozac,i have been experiencing major depression and suicidal thought it got to the point that all i wanted to do everyday is stay in bed not eat check my blood pressure all day to make sure im not having a aneurysm or stroke i take the problem of my patient and relate them to myself so in case i get the symptom they had before having a medical emergency i start to panic and lose my appetite etc i also suffer from anxiety and panic attack ive seen a psychologist who wa helpful but once i left it wa hard for me to focus on the thing we talked about due to my daily repetitive ritual of stressing and being depressed ive been on prozac for week mg have all the side effect but seems to be a break through ill see after a month
2881,fluoxetine,been taking fluoxetine for about month it ha been wonderful i simply do not worry about thing that used to bother me all the time the only down side i am experiencing are that ive lost a lot of weight and that i dont feel emotion nowhere near a strongly a before for example my mother passed away and while it wa a very sad time it just didnt upset me a it should have done i would strongly recommend this medicine though
2882,xanax,i suffer from social anxiety rarely leave the house the anxiety leaf me isolated which cause extreme depression with xanax mg to mg take all anxiety away and calm my depression out of taking xanax for over year now
2883,xanax,the only medication that stop my paralyzing panic attack generally work within minute side effect are nonexistent
2884,prozac,taking prozac for premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a miracle but when i hit forty it really got worse especially at period time my thought were so messed up i would think thing that i knew wasnt normal and cry because of the most ridiculous reason or just non stop cry for no reason irritated beyond expression and like my body wa on speed but all out of my control i could not get in control of my mood or thought so last year at my gyno appointment i mentioned this bizarre experience i would have prior to my period she explains pdd and prescribed prozac i take mine day prior and every other day or every third day because it make me feel draggy just depends how it affect me that month i take it before i go to bed work great new life
2885,alprazolam,best prescription medicine ever im on mg time a day a needed for the past year it ha made my life so much better i highly recommend trying this medicine if you feel that you need help give it a shot if you dont like it then dont take it i give it out of

2892,adderall,wa the only drug that wa effective
2893,alprazolam,xanax saved me from the brink i suffer from panic disorder and anxiety and xanax ha been the only thing that work the only thing respect it dont drink alcohol on it or you will become highly intoxicated and possibly get sleep apnea respect this drug and it will serve you well
2894,fluoxetine,i used to have horrible nightmare couldnt sleep sometimes because of vision in the dark occasional sudden bout of intense unjustified anger etc ive been on prozac more or le im not great about taking the pill for year now i probably average mgday over time if i stop taking it for several week i will notice the angry spell starting to come back etc and thats my cue that i need to start taking it again it ha been very helpful for me it not a cure all and maybe the high of life are not a frequent but they still come and id rather have that and contentment than the awful low no free ride but i enjoy my friend exercise family and relationship overall a godsend for me
2895,mydayis,i cant believe all these negative review the only praise i hear are one that sound like quotstage actorsquot who are planted in to these website and being paid to boast about the wonder of this medicine this medication wa created because shire no longer held the patent of adderall so came up with a new drug for doctor to push so shire could make more money again at the same time all the generic of adderall that one were so great are now weak and inferior ive never been so depressed and feel there is nothing to look forward to anymore after having adderall pulled out from underneath my foot i just plug through my day just to get the day over with my family suffers due to big pharma greed
2896,xanax,i have been on xanax for about year and i used to have really bad panic attack but i dont now the only problem i have with them is that they have made me gain a ton of weight
2897,xanax xr,i have daily anxiety and wa on ativan for a while and while i loved the ativan i wa looking for something longer acting my psychiatrist tried me on xanax xr mg for me this medicine is a god send in the beginning when i first starting taking it i did notice some slight dizziness and weird feeling but i stuck with it and once it regulated in my system about week i feel totally normal and calm on it with zero side effect i have since upped my dose to the mg xanax xr twice daily if i need it but some day i only take one pill to get me through the day and deal with the anxiety at night since im home and then take a pill in the morning like normal my advice would be to start it on the lowest dose and work your way up
2899,fluoxetine,ive been on prozac for a little over a year for depression and anxiety im on mg since i wa personally i think it wa too much for my system when i first started taking it i wa like an adhd child couldnt calm down jumping around everywhere and could barely sleep at night and with me being a lb year old my mother thought so too now that im i think this medication isnt working for me anymore im becoming more and more depressed and my anxiety level is at it highest i keep having panic attack also prozac wa amazing for me up til now but i do believe that my body ha gotten used to this medication im talking to my doctor soon a possible to maybe raise my dosage

2956,alprazolam,i have been on xanax for about year and i used to have really bad panic attack but i dont now the only problem i have with them is that they have made me gain a ton of weight
2957,xanax,ive been taking this medicine for year i only take themg pill when im having a panic attack sometimes more than other time for me it is a god sent that horrible tightness in your chest and shortness in breath is unbearable however i can see how someone could get hooked on this drug
2958,fluoxetine,ive been off and on the prozac for over a year now keep reading stuff on the internet about it side effect then flush them down the drain but then i get back on the medicine i can say that i feel it effect after just one dose it feel like a pretty strong drug and im only on mg dont drink too much caffeine on prozac ive had the worst anxiety attack if i drink an energy drink after taking my dose of prozac it doe help me get stuff done and stay motivated and i guess it help with general anxiety a well it doe kind of make me impulsive though but im learning to make better decision while on the medicine i think it help over all and i will continue to stay on it for the foreseeable future
2959,fluoxetine,i went from mg to mg and felt tip top it curbed my obsessive compulsive disorder and it no longer ruled my life completely unfortunately i wa feeling that good i started drinking to often which stopped the medication working i then convinced myself it would no longer work even though i stopped drinking i then went onto citalopram which did nothing for me at all i then missed a doc appointment and then decided i would get through it all without tablet i wa ok for a while until the anxiety ocd started to bully me again i wa a nightmare to live with countless argument with my missus i couldnt handle anything shouting screaming at my child im back on fluoxedtine now and really regret coming off it like i did
2960,alprazolam,i dont know how to explain the turmoil and suffering that i went through in the mid ninety even after a perfect childhood at year old i found myself pound in the hospital because i could not eat i could not sleep and i could not function however misdiagnosed a an eating disorder and depression it took me quite a few time to even go to a doctor that noticed i may be a bit nervous i bet that wa an understatement because i keep getting slack about the medication i have tried kalanapin which brought me out like a teenager and did not work for me i have tried valium which wa way too strong for me i have been on this medication for over year and have never had to up my dosage not once and it still work
2961,xanax,i have been taking mg at night for yr i get for a month supply it ha been a miracle for me amp my depression i have tried all antidepressant which only make me feel worse amp even suicidal xanax is a life saver for me my doctor now want me to start again with a antidepressant i will not i think he want to wean me off xanax because of all the negative addictive effect
2962,xanax xr,in my opinion this medicine ha saved my life it keep me calm and relaxed it ha been my miracle drug i never knew life could be this good again i try not to remember the life i had before taking xanax
2963,fluoxetine,i started prozac a year ago for severe anxiety and depression i now feel like a whole different person only thing im wondering is if i gained weight from it i am now lb heavier than last year but i started a different birth control at the same time so that could be it a well
2964,alprazolam,i am prescribed mg xanax twice a day a needed it work very well for me when i have high anxiety i have no side effect at all from this drug i dont even get sleepy with it i just feel calmer i have taken a variety of benzodiazepine for year and i have never had a problem with an addiction to any of them and i have a history of drug abuse i would just say to take a needed and at the correct dose and dont take continuously for a long time and you should do good with xanax
2965,xanax,i have been taking xanax off and on for about year now it is great for anxiety i spent thousand of dollar going to the er thinking i wa having a heart attack before it wa brought to my attention that it wa actually anxiety i take mg a needed now i noticed that when i stopped taking it that i could not sleep for day and i became shaky at time and the anxiety return immediately the other thing that i notice is that after a while you become immune to the dosage if you only take it with the onset of an anxiety or panic attack it shouldnt be a problem
2967,xanax,the mg xanax made my life easyer to live before i thought everyone wa talkin about me and couldnt sleep but now im the life of the party
2968,fluoxetine,i took prozac for year and it worked great for obsessive compulsive disorder about year ago i started noticing quotmaniaquot where i couldnt sleep or sit still to even eat after seeing several different doctor who treated it with medication for adhd or bipolar it wa determined that it wa a side effect to prozac so i stopped taking prozac and all the mania stopped google show two side effect to prozac are cant sit still and cant sleep at night i wanted to share this unusual experience to help any others who may be experiencing mania and cant figure out why if you too are on prozac then it may be a side effect but check with your doctor
2969,fluoxetine,im i wa diagnosed with depression and anxiety and told to take fluoxetine i have been on it for week and since then i have stopped having panic attack but have experienced some horrible side effect including headache vomiting heartburn that lasted hour insomnia fit of giggle lethargy muscle ache loss of libido dizziness sensitivity to light and a general feeling of not being altogether so the medication ha stopped my low mood and constant anxiety but ha made me feel ill
2972,fluoxetine,took paxil for the past year for anxietydepressionpanic stopped it year ago to pursue pregnancy i did well for the st mo but then began to fall apart anxiety panic attack depression all returned i wa put on prozac because it pregnancy friendly about week ago ive had the worst refluxheartburn ive ever had in my life i take the pill at night because it made me sleepy the st day when i took it in the morning im currently on day the reflux is slightly better but i have increased anxietypanic i hadnt had this the st week doe anyone have an similar story i appreciate feedback im not sure whether to stick it out on prozac or switch to a different med
2975,fluoxetine,i took my self to the hospital because my life wa and still is falling apart but after i took prozac i started the feel a bit better but just a someone here mentioned after i took it my mind felt empty for example since before i went to the hospital thought of self hatred self loathing and plenty of suicidal thought took up of my brain each day but since they were gone due to the medicine my brain wa unsure how to react the worst thing in the world could have happened to me and i wouldnt do anything just smile but it felt weird but i did feel a strange sense of optimism while on the drug im never optimistic always pessimistic i stopped month ago i think im going to the hospital soon anyway i feel it
2977,fluoxetine,ive been depressed with high level of anxiety for ten year i tried several different medication and i finally settled with an antidepressant to help with sleep and also wa taking klonopin a day a well a trazodone at night for sleep for seven year so im really thinking i may be on all these medicine for life and maybe be put on disability so the doc finally put me on prozac it been month now and my anxiety ha gone way down i am le depressed i no longer worry about thing and am off trazodone and dont take klonopin anymore i have great dream and wake up every morning with happy song in my head and im much more social prozac ha just been a blessing probably saved my life a i had lost all hope
2978,alprazolam,work real fastfor breakthrough anxietyor panic attackssaved my life
2980,alprazolam,used for week to treat muscle spasm and phobia after asking my doctor to wean me off we followed a regimen and it wa the worst withdrawal i have ever experienced in my whole life even worse than thing that ive taken in the past i suffered temporal epileptic seizure for day and wa staring at the door for an hour before my girlfriend smacked me to wake me up day later i suffered two consecutive grand mal seizure that broke my skull and nose i had never history of seizure brain mri eeg done last year came out clear and crystal and this medicine lowered my threshold so much month after i stopped it i am not the same i am not the same anymore please be careful and think ten time before you decide to drop it
2981,prozac,after about week on prozac or a i like to call it crapzac i wa more depressed than ever before before crapzac i had only considered suicide a few time but after my th week i actually attempted it thankfully my sister found me and brought me to the hospital where they asked if i had been on any medication and ordered me to stop taking it and i wa trapped at the hospital in the psych ward for day having session with the counsellor every day strapped down to my bed for the first few day and not allowed to use the bathroom for day this stuff made my life into a living hell after being released i have now started seeing a therapist and now ive been practicing yoga and meditation with no med and i feel great
2982,prozac,i have been taking prozac for about four year my worst symptom were very disturbing vivid dream that affected my sleep having feeling of uncontrollable anger feeling hopeless and powerless and wanting to give up at the slightest difficulty being on prozac ha been wonderful for me the nightmare have pretty much gone away i am much more calm and patient and i can deal with the unexpected problem in life much better i think prozac made it possible for me to finish grad school and ha helped my career i dont feel addicted to it in fact i frequently forget to take it for several day or even a week or more but when i notice the nightmare or anxiety coming back i know it time for me to take it again
2983,alprazolam,i started out valium for about year mg x a day used for anxiety and sleep it worked wa a comfort to know most of the time used per day so i always had extra i think knowing i had extra help almost a much then dr changed prescription to alprazolam mg tablet time a day some heavy difference at first it worked well in the beginning i felt it minute after i took it and only needed per day now im at per day thats mg and i dont feel it i dont know about withdrawal but i hear it pretty hard to get off and ive been on them for year not sure what to expect but think i would feel more alert and energetic too
2984,fluoxetine,i suffered with obsessive compulsive disorder amp generalized anxiety disorder which caused depression and stress i came on here in june looking for answer i used to be on sertraline but they stopped working after i had stopped and went back on them i thought my life wa over i got put on mg prozac by my doctor and it is the best medicine ever i would highly recommend it it gave me my life back i am so happy no more stress also i have no side effect give it about week trust me and you will see how this work unbelievable
2986,xanax,very helpful in reducing anxiety for me it is fastacting and it made a difference in me being able to keep up with my job now im on klonopin though since the doctor said that it stay in the system longer for anxiety however the fast relief of xanax work very well when an immediate spike in anxiety happens the effect usually only last a few hour for me and i can understand how it can be addictive for this reason but it been great for immediate panic symptom and helpful with focusing i did not notice that quotdrugged upquot foggy feeling on a small dose of mg mg a needed
2987,fluoxetine,i wasnt sure if this drug wa helping with ocd when asked i would reply quotit seems to make it easier to deal with itquot then my doc decided to lower my dose in order to take me off it when i got to mg i lost it the obsessive thought were out of control compulsion increased a well i am back on mg and feeling and thinking much better the med help a lot but doesnt fix me completely i challenge my compulsion every day so i can reinforce that i do not need them
2988,fluoxetine,i had slipped into a depression following some traumatic life event the morning were worse and often unbearable i became suicidal i wa also agitated i wa desperate and went to gp and prescribed fluoxetine mg i have been taking them for six week and feel so much better mood ha lifted and morning depression ha stopped it saved my life side effect were a sore throat and cold symptom which lasted four day yawning a well best thing i ever did wa admit i had a problem and take medicine
2989,prozac,it didnt work i wa up to mg daily and felt literally nothing ever since i had my son i have had panic attack and bad anxiety so i went to the doctor and wa prescribed prozac i wa so disappointed i almost feel more depressed now
2990,alprazolam,my doctor prescribed mg which i take half a tablet going to bed if that doesnt work i take the other half depends on how much sleep i need or how much anxiety i have if im exhausted the medicine is great i fall asleep and next thing i know im awake in the morning but it usually leaf a hangover which i hate i try to deal with my anxiety holisticly but sometimes that doe not work i think it all come down to eating healthy and watching my sugar and carb and caffeine intake walking and doing stretch work for me but honestly having someone who really love you and doe not abuse you in anyway is the best answer but i dont think there many people out there like that anymore koliopin is a horrible dangerous drug all pharmaceutical a far a im concerned are bad for u and then least we take it the better off we are
2992,fluoxetine,my doctor prescribed me this medication after i had been suffering in silence for almost yr with extreme anxiety and depression it ha totally changed my life my everyday thinking and my overall mind set i no longer worry about my anxiety attack and feel i can take on all the normal thing in life thing just keep getting better i have no intention of stopping taking this medicine a i went without for a few day a while ago and felt rubbish with all the old feeling back it worked miracle for me i just wish i had started taking it year ago
2993,adderall xr,i began taking this before i began any other medication it made me more anxious and nervous it also seemed to increase my ocd the quotpure oquot form by making me more prone to think about my ocd it did help me to focus on occasion but it also made me focus on my anxiety and obsession a well my therapist told me that stimulant like this one and concerta are not good for people with anxiety disorder almost all of them unless they have anxiety because they can not focus and accomplish necessary task i recommend talking to a counselor or psychologistpsychiatrist before being prescribed stimulant for adhd
2995,fluoxetine,i wa put on mirtazapine by my doctor recently and the side effect of it were horrendous slept for hour on end when i did get up i wa living through a fog i couldnt function on a day to day basis the nightmare were awful vivid very scary dream that i couldnt force myself to wake from so i decided enough i had been on citalopram before that and it wa no longer helping so i wa switched to the mirtazapine i went back on prozac and in le than a week i feel better my head is clear and i can do thing i enjoy i dont sleep well anyway so the prozac ha no effect on that i will stick with the prozac

3008,alprazolam,i have been diagnosed with depression and panic disorder for year now i learned over the year that if i could keep my anxietypanic under good control i would be much le likely to go into depression uncontrolled anxiety greatly increase the chance i will experience depression xanax work extremely well at keeping my anxiety and hence depression under control these day i dont need to use it continuously because just knowing that xanax is there and work so well if i need it ha a calming effect i didnt give xanax though because it ha one annoying side effect for me it kill my libido rather effectively if i take it for a few day apart from that very tolerable way more so than any antidepressant i wa on
3010,prozac,ive been on prozac for a little over a year for depression and anxiety im on mg since i wa personally i think it wa too much for my system when i first started taking it i wa like an adhd child couldnt calm down jumping around everywhere and could barely sleep at night and with me being a lb year old my mother thought so too now that im i think this medication isnt working for me anymore im becoming more and more depressed and my anxiety level is at it highest i keep having panic attack also prozac wa amazing for me up til now but i do believe that my body ha gotten used to this medication im talking to my doctor soon a possible to maybe raise my dosage

3018,xanax,i use xanax mg for anxiety and panic disorder this medicine ha been the only drug that ha brought relief to to my constant anxiety i dont know where id be without it i take the use of this drug very seriously and dont abuse it i use it only when needed for panic or when anxiety is so intense i simply cant tolerate it any longer when used properly this drug is safe and you will not become addicted it very fast acting min which is important when a panic attack hit side effect are minimal for me i get the quotjelly legsquot and thats about it it never made me stumble or fall though the generic version isnt quite a good a the real stuff but if you must use generic the round blue tab are better than the oval one
3019,alprazolam,ive been struggling with severe anxiety and depression since i wa a child ive tried everything for anxiety lexapro celexa effexor xr prozac and xanax it been the only medication that ha really saved my life from this illness otherwise if i dont take it i wont be able work or live i know that there is so much stigma about how it addicting and it abused if you genuinely have a serious anxiety disorder dont focus on the stigma take them or try to live the severe anxiety you sort of have to pick your poison i have never abused xanax i started taking klonopin for about a year and wa switched to xanax ive always taken my medicine a prescribed right now im taking mg and it doe wonder for me

3027,prozac,i wanted to share my experience with prozac for those that are perhaps just starting out letting them know that it doe in fact get much better i have had pretty bad anxiety since childhood and also the symptom of pmdd for a few year now also to the point that i would schedule event around when i wa going to have pm because it made me so unable to deal with anything at all i wa snapping at people got easily frustrated with my child and would feel very down on myself in general since going on prozac approximately week ago i went through a very anxious phase but the last two week have been amazing i have never felt this happy or calm i am on mg with no plan to stop

3109,alprazolam,effectively and rapidly eliminates symptom of my anxiety also work well in calming my thought down only downside of this medication that i can conjure up is a propensity to make me lethargicbut this is only a significant problem if im not engaged in some sort of physical or mental diversion

3113,prozac,prozac is my miracle medicine i have been on different antidepressant over the year and prozac is the only one that ever helped me feel quotnormalquot with no side effect it is wonderful it hard to find an ssri that cause no side effect for me prozac ha been the only one and i just love it my quality of life is much better now and i can function in a happy state of mind wonderful
3114,xanax,i have severe anxiety including social anxiety that confines me to my apartment of the time i also suffer from trichotillomania where my anxiety is so bad i pull my hair out have had this for year and all the shrink could not help me i am year old and just recently have been put on xanax mg time daily a needed well the first week i slept and slept which is good because i wasnt sleeping before i also have bipolar disorder and severe depression pristiq help a little but i am allergic to everything else xanax slows down my racing thought so i can think clearer and make decision easier and is helping with the hair pulling but am still desperately searching for help with that and have not found it
3115,alprazolam,after ear surgery the tinnitus had grown louder then i could bear it became overwhelming to be in group of people larger than hard to concentrate at work or at play because of the weird loud constant sound and forget about going to sleep if you focus in on the noise your mind will not let go of it alprazolam ha not made it go away but ha put it where it belongs in the far off background which ha allowed me to live a pretty normal life once again thankful
3116,fluoxetine,i have been on several different ssri before and havent seen much improvement so far this seems to be the only antidepressant thats worked for me and hasnt given me too many side effect i wa on luvox which wasnt helping at all for any of the multiple condition it wa prescribed to treat and wa switched to an equivalent dose of prozac ever since starting it ive had more energy and have been able to smile laugh and overall just feel like a normal person for me in combination with seroquel adderall for adhd but also give what i take for depression a little boost and wellbutrin this is a wonder drug it still help me get through every day after quite a few month on it couldnt say the same about other ssri
3117,alprazolam,doe not work enough for what i thought i still panic a lot but this only seems to slow down how long i panic i want the panic and thought to all go away not just parttime
3118,alprazolam,this drug work wonder on most people including myself it calmed my panic it helped my depression and helped me see life for what it is instead of worrying about every little problem
3119,xanax,this is the only drug that ha kept my generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder under control i prescribed this by my pcp when i wa about and have been taking it up to the present i couldnt go without it
3120,alprazolam,i wa very young and i would get a feeling of not being able to breathe so i would lay down breathe slowly and that wa not helping me anymore so i wa put on xanax i didnt even have to take all that wa perscribed that is how well it helped
3121,adderall xr,i started taking adderall xr day ago and i love it i immediately started focusing better i now feel great when i wake up knowing that i will be able to get thing done that have been put off for so long my memory and self esteem have improved dramatically only side effect i am experiencing are dry mouth and mild headache

3124,prozac,life saver i feel that i wa possibly depressed for maybe a decade or le but soon after my father passed away about two year ago i hit rock bottom i wa extremely depressed i just couldnt function emotionally physically etc i would sleep all the time i just overall felt like life wa not exciting anymore and that i lost my sense of identity or having a purpose not only did my father passing cause me to become more depressed but lot of other major traumatic stressor hit me all at once too so i had and still have a lot going on but since i have been taking prozac only mg i am alive again and happy i just feel normal i dont cry anymore i feel amazing oh and no side effect at all just happiness
3125,alprazolam,great for getting uninterrupted sleepno groggy feeling in the morning however tolerance to medicine is pretty quick therefore it ha not proven to be the best remedy
3126,prozac,it work it wasnt the magic bullet for me wellbutrin wa it for me but i still take this in a mg dose to help with thing mainly still taking it because i wa tapered down from mg which wa giving me sexual side effect while simultaneously upping the wellbutrin and have been stable ever sense so dr just want to let it be because it working going to ask for a reduction in this next time though a i feel that the wellbutrin is most likely enough on it own at the high dose i am currently on mg this medicine is definitely worth trying and work for lot of people just wasnt the end all be all for me personally
3127,adderall,my stomach couldnt handle the normal adderall so i tried adderall xr it took a while for me to really enjoy the medication but with combination of cymbalta i dont have real ups and down i take mg i am a muscular pound male i would recommend adderall side effect dependancy dry mouth le hunger until you come down at night
3128,adderall,adderall ir had the same duration of action a adderall xr for me both of them only had lasting effect for four hour and then quit

3131,fluoxetine,i have been taking this medication since so far people around me have noticed a change but i still dont see a change that is so dramatic that i should continue using this medicine i still feel extremely low at time and all they do is keep increasing my dosage
3134,fluoxetine,i have taken prozac and mg quite a few year ago with really positive outcome but at a point it stopped working so i went to welbutrin recently i started to get panic again and my doctor thought adding prozac into my daily regimen would help because it worked so well in the past the side effect were so difficult for week cry unable to eat anxiety every minute lost about pound which wa a good side effect but they did subside it seemed to be working but now some day i am having anxiety again and tremor daily unfortunately it isnt working this time around and will be switching off it but i would definitely recommend it for people since it did once work wonderfully for my panic and gad

3140,xanax,tend to have dream while on this drug
3141,adderall,i started taking adderall in to with a month break in due pregnancy and breastfeeding i wa diagnosed with add a a child but held off on taking medication until i wa adderall immediately helped with focus and even energy and motivation i excelled at work and finally wa able to complete task instead of starting them and trailing off to something else in when i discontinued adderall i wa taking a pretty high prescribed dose of mg twice a day i started noticing the con of the come down were outweighing the pro of when the medication wa working i had anxiety irritability and extreme fatigue they switched me to dex which wa much smoother but ha increased my bp i try vyvanse tomorrow
3142,prozac,i have had general anxiety for a long a i can remember and it started really interfering with my daily life and relationship my doctor put me on prozac with mg dosage the first week i did have a bit of nausea so it wa hard eating in the morning but thats the only side effect i noticed it helped me get rid of anxious thought that had once wrecked my life and made me calm without ridding me of my outgoing and bubbly personality that made me really happy however i have now been on it for almost month and i am noticing a large decrease in sex drive it ha started effecting my relationship so im currently looking at other option other than that i would recommend
3143,alprazolam,i have chronic interstitial cystitis not sure on spelling also called painful bladder syndrome it is like a urinary tract infection time i have to go to bathroom any where from every minute up to time every hour so it can be a problem if im away from home if i take my xanax mg i usually dont have to go to bathroom but once every or hr and since it hurt so bad to urinate and plus i can get sleep at night with not having to go every hour it ha been such a relief i rate it a my doctor ha it written or every hour a needed but i try to only take it at night im very cautious

3180,alprazolam,i take alprazolam for panic attack which can hit at any time and be severe within just a minute or so i can take a half of one of these when i feel a panic attack coming on and it usually stop it if it get to a fullblown attack then i can take a whole one and it will knock it out the only problem is that it doe make me sleepy which is much better than the panic attack
3181,xanax,i am so thankful for this medication it ha saved me countless trip to the er due to severe gripping panic attack it took about year of anxiety useless quottryingquot of several ssri and dozen of trip to the hospital hyperventilating shaking screaming with my pulse approaching before a smart doctor finally prescribed me xanax i take the medication on an asneeded basis and sparingly i take mg half pill to prevent anxiety attack when anticipating an panicinducing situation i take mg at the first sign an attack is starting the quickest most effective route is to lightly crush the pill with your teeth and let it dissolve beneath your tongue my experience with xanax is pretty much identical to that of ativan
3183,prozac,i just started taking prozac and i have had this terrible migraine it worse than any migraine i have ever had ive been throwing up and sleeping throughout the day i dont feel myself at all
3184,fluoxetine,i had a good start in life a single mom an older brother a state job a girl a quiet house in my hometown i almost lost it all due to alcohol i could write a book of how to use alcohol to flirt with prison the grim reaper and insanity i started drinking when i wa and i am now i never really stopped drinking that entire time i then started taking prozac mg a day i am now alcohol free for a year and have no desire to drink at all it helped me amazingly but i wa also finally ready to quit drinking

3186,xanax,i have been on every medication out there to help with my anxietydepression i wa taking effexor which worked at first but i noticed that my head wa just filled with unnecessary garbage to say the least my dr took me off of the effexor and replaced it with brintellix and saphris which really helped my mood and depression but my anxiety wa still affecting me to the point i thought i wa having a stroke he prescribed my mg of xanax time a day and wow the difference is night and day i am actually able to function normally and am so relieved im still scared to be taking it because of the addiction that can come with it but with my drs guidance i am feeling better about this medication my anxiety ha subsided grateful
3188,xanax,ive been on mg of xanax tablet time a day along with mg of prozac i have severe panic disorder ive been on this dose for many year and have not experienced any quottolerancequot issue xanax get a bad rap because many people abuse it or go above the drs prescribed dose see your dr if this isnt working for you dont take more than what youre prescribed everybody break down medication differently
3189,fluoxetine,i have been on fluoxetine mg for six month it took about week to notice any positive mood change after a few week of starting it i began to feel like i wa living in a fog and had a difficult time concentrating but that eventually went away and turned into optimism and feeling great please give it a couple of month to work it take time to kick in after week i felt good and happy for a while but recently have relapsed into anxiety and depression again my md ha now upped my dosage to mg i am hopeful i will get the happiness and optimism back again soon from the higher dose
3191,alprazolam,i wa prescibed xanax and it work well for thing like panic attack i do not like that it make me loopy by taking my prescibed mg and if i cut it in half i feel that it doesnt work at all xanax work very well for short term anxiety and if highly addictive so it is best to take it when you absolutely need it a prn that is supposed to work like xanax but isnt addictive start with a v so ask your doctor about that
3193,prozac,helped me to stop cry on a daily basis which i wa doing because of my fibromyalgia pain still have the pain but have a better attitude
3194,alprazolam,i am about to turn and my life of anxiety ha been a recent and unpleasant downward spiral i ended up in the emergency room twice with soaring blood pressure flushing and heart palpitation plus overwhelming feeling of panic i live daily with either anxiety or small panic attack they are debilitating and have affected my ability to continue work on my degree after my last er visit a doc felt i wa having panic attack and directed me to seek help at a mental health clinic ive tried several antidepressant and i have not tolerated them well xanax mg ha gotten me through many a day and night and i prefer this medication over all the others it decrease the anxiety very quickly and help to maintain a sense of normality
3195,fluoxetine,prozac saved me ive been in and out of hospital for year wa diagnosed with major depressive disorder after changing doctor and medicine i finally feel like myself again i here no voice of worry and stress im not irritated over the slightest thing i can now think clearer after month of depression and panic attracts my new doctor recommended prozac for week i felt nausea and weakness then on the third week i got up and out and got a job the same day i wa no longer stuttering and confused my relationship with my significant other is better my thought were very clear id finally gained my confidence back im very happy i tried prozac i feel amazing
3196,alprazolam,have been suffering from anxiety and recently have been having panic attack i started zoloft about a week ago but am using xanax in the meantime for shortterm relief the pill is amazing and calm me down within about minute such a wonderful drug
3197,prozac,im and have been on prozac for about month and i must say that it a great antidepressant there are very few side effect for me including an upset stomach feeling anxious and few others which kept improving over time this medicine really helped me to deal with my depression many symptom like inability to maintain concentration panic attack losing control brain fog hopelessness extreme negativism fear of death improved within week and kept improving onwards im still on it and i just love it and i think it can help anyone with depression with the pace of time prozac really helped me stay positive about everything sometimes i feel like i have already overcome my depression it really helpful
3200,alprazolam,for year i didnt know i wa suffering from anxiety and panic attack my doctor told me what wa happening to me amp prescribed xanax it help me tremendously i feel quotnormalquot now been using it for year
3202,fluoxetine,i wa put on fluoxetine mg daily due to a particularly bad bout of depression that left me unable to work or even get out of bed that wa over a year ago and it wa a godsend i started on mg and increased to within a month close to no side effect some stomach pain and the relief of my depression happened within the first week after a month and a half on it i wa feeling great and alive again it wa amazing after month on the medication i decided to wean off that went well however anxiety started building up again i believe my condition ha now changed i wa put back on fluoxetine mg but felt no relief of my anxiety whatsoever and had to add ativan to my regimen i am now exploring other option but it wa great
3203,alprazolam,i have severe depression and general anxiety disorder i take mgday of zoloft and that pretty well take care of my depression and most of my panic attack occasionally ill take mg for a panic attack but im cautious because sometimes the downside of coming off a panic attack sends me into a fit of depression i highly recommend both zoloft and xanax i just want to put the word out there to use good judgement when treating a panic attack when you have depression a well
3204,alprazolam,it make my hand a little shaky
3205,fluoxetine,i started taking prozac in april of for anxiety and depression it took about a month to actually start working i feel better going into public and dont freak out and go into the bathroom im still depressed but it improved so much it gave me side effect like lose of appetite i lost pound my first month taking it and i wa always tired but had trouble falling asleep another negative is if i miss it a day i have painful headache and lash out on everyone and treat them terrible
3206,fluoxetine,i have suffered from premenstrual dysphoric disorder ever since i had my period i would cry for no reason lose focus at work get anxiety attack it affected my daily life with mood swing i would be this way for around day before starting my actual period the doctor prescribed me fluoxetine mg to take day before my period i had taken prozac in the past for what i thought wa depression which wa really bad pm pmdd so i took the prozac for day before my period and i wa feeling much better prozac truly doe help
3207,adderall,i would like to first say that my experience with adderall wa overall successful it most definitely helped my concentration and ability to focus however there are some side effect that i think are worth noting i had minimal anxiety prior to taking this medication only when traveling my anxiety dramatically increased to the point where i wa put in therapy and almost took a medical leave from work i quit taking the medication once i realized it wa a significant contributing factor although not completely to blame i had a very dry mouth while prescribed which actually ended up leading to cavity according to my dentist noticeable lower back pain amp problem sleeping both are alleviated once you quit taking the med
3209,prozac,first week wa hell more anxiety and panic attack had to leave work early one day for the anxiety also left a family event early but now starting second week and starting to feel like myself again a long a thing continue this way will be happy on this drug without the first week side effect would give it a
3210,adderall xr,i take my in the morning with a light breakfast n ill be set for most of the day it seems pretty alright to me
3212,fluoxetine,fluoxetine is pretty gentle compared to most other antidepressant medicine i had a good response from zoloft almost year ago and when i had breakthrough depression i wa switched to effexor effexor worked but wa prohibitively expensive then i wa finally stated on prozacfluoxetine i had zero side effect during the first weekwhich wa vastly different from my experience with the other twoand at mgday fluoxetine seems just a efficacious fluoxetine ha worked well for my panic depression and general anxiety one must give it time to work for people that are really struggling six week can seem a lifetime but for many that is how long it take for fluoxetine to work
3213,xanax,this is the only one i feel safe taking im prescribed mg x a day or a needed i took zoloft wellbutrinseroquel etc felt horrible coming off all of these with xanax i feel like i can take it when i need it and put it down the next day if i dont unlike the other antidepressant that cause brain zap or worse side effect feeling of a rollercoaster coming down
3214,adderall,it make a huge difference in my day i hate having to take something everyday to stay awake and alert but better then living in the fog i wa in the past year of my life of which i didnt even notice they were side effect of something bigger haha thing you may notice while taking adderall with narcolepsy you are stop being a shut in you actually start calling your friend to do something instead of getting harassed till you finally cave and do something youre better at work and all of a sudden care about your job you are grinding your jaw stop grinding your jaw and finally work with your doctor for the right dosage there will be a bit of dancing between cracked out and half asleep till you find it
3216,xanax,i have taken xanax now for six month and it ha been the best six month in a long time i have finally been able to go out in place where before i absolutely would not go for fear of panic attack i wa on mg ativan and mg tranxene before and all i did wa stay in my house and sleep thank goodness my doctor prescribed xanax
3217,prozac,disclaimer this is my personal experience started prozac at age after issue with effexor and after a few month i felt on top of the worldthe happiest i had ever been this wa short lived after or so month something inside me snapped sex drive my conscious turned into someone that wasnt me never heard voice before but they became overwhelmingevil amp i couldnt shake the suicidal thought i ended up quitting cold turkey a i noticed myself double dosing then triple dosing my sex drive is still ive gained a ton of weight and have been dealing with severe depression without med because im scared to take them again
3218,xanax,ive never taken xanax before up until now ive tried effexor viibryd wellbutrin etc but none of those worked at all and i could not handle the side effect xanax ha given me my life back my panic attack have finally reduced but more importantly i can continue to function in my normal everyday life most other medicine have me sitting on the couch in the evening doing absolutely nothing a nothing seemed to matter with xanax i can effectively handle my overwhelming daily task list
3219,prozac,this drug saved my life it did not work for the first month and a half but when it did amazing result no anxiety and i suffered from panic attack not saying this drug alone will fix all your problem but it helped me so so much gave me my excitement for life back
3220,fluoxetine,only going into week four however i have left my house more in the past ten day than i have in the past several month starting to clean the house to the amazement of my family lol also amazing how much better the child and husband respond when im not biting their head off every time they approach first week just plain felt weird kind of emotionless or with increased anxiety second week almost the same almost decided to quit taking it after two week of obsessing and reading probably every review in existence online of fluoxetine i decided i wa going to stick it out for a minimum of six week boy am i glad i did i havent functioned this well for about fifteen year
3222,prozac,i have suffered bulimia for about year and at different stage wa bingingpurging up to time a day over the year i have tried so many medication but prozac is the first to really assist i started on mg which ha recently increased to mg this is the only medicinetherapy that ha dramatically decreased my impulse to bingepurge i am feeling so happy within myself and it ha really assisted with my depression and low energy level too one odd side effect i have noted is that i am yawning a lot a small price to pay to being in control of my eating and mood this is definitely worth a try if you are having bulimic symptom and recommend it highly good luck
3223,alprazolam,had panic attack since i wa been on xanax since then if i dont take it ill get an attack
3224,fluoxetine,about month of using this medicine i started to notice the way it effected my thinking thing would come up in my life that wouldve normally triggered my depression however when these thing happened i felt a fake sense of relief i felt like i wanted to be upset about these thing that were happening but my brain wouldnt let me it felt unfamiliar and unlike myself it wa a though i could feel a whole layer of feeling that i wa unable to express my doctor switched me over to zoloft and im noticing better result
3226,alprazolam,a many people stated xanax ha given me my life back along side paxil when i had severe severe anxiety i took half a xanax daily but now that im thankfully a million time better i only take it once in a blue moon when i feel like i need it and take a quarter of a pill this is amazing
3227,fluoxetine,this ha made such a difference to my life it is like the quotvoicequot that continues to tell me i am too fat and that all the quotbadquot thing in life would be better if only i were thinner ha weakened it is still there but i dont have to listen if fact i can even ignore it what a relief it ha made me realize just how much time i wa spending listening to all the negative thought planning the food covering up the vomiting i finally feel quotnormalquot what a relief
3228,prozac,wonderful drug but watch out for medication interaction developed serotonin syndrome when doctor prescribed ultram tramadol for pain relief caused involuntary muscle spasm difficulty speaking walking etc even looked like i had a stroke i tapered off it shortly after and tried other drug to help with anxiety depression and pmdd i have since come back to prozac because it work well for me a long a i make sure not to take tramadol or other drug that can interact with it i experience weight loss with this drug have ton of energy and sleep well at night
3230,prozac,prozac for anxiety and stress i started prozac mg on january i feel great so far with no anxiety and panicky feeling not everyday is perfect but that is life the first two week on prozac mg it made my anxiety high it made me nauseated unable to eat and unable to sleep since i suffer from gad mg suddenly stopped working and i went up to mg increased to mg it gave me a lot of anxiety and panicky feeling again after one week or so the anxiety wa gone the panicky feeling wa also gone i have tried three other ad and they all gave me chronic nausea and headache however on prozac i feel great i do feel nausea at but it is manageable give prozac week before you quit two thumb up

3305,fluoxetine,i have titled this anxiety and stress but also have been suffering from major depression suicidal ideation pureo ocd and premenstrual dysphoric disorder im currently on mg fluoxetine and can honestly say that this medication ha saved my life it hasnt been plain sailing ive had period when i felt so tired that i couldnt move and i had the worst panic attack and anxiety ever for the first couple of week hang in there i purposely ensured that my dosage increased gradually similar to the cranzac method so it probably another day before i get the full mg effect so i am expecting even more side effect but i feel indescribably better than before a true wonder drug if you can stick out the bad day
3307,adderall xr,i started on mg adderall xr month ago i wa diagnosed with adhd when i wa i wa first medicated on ritalin and i went off of it because it made me very uneasy on the inside i managed to get through school with all applied course because a gold fish had a higher attention span then me if i could turn back time i would have chosen the adderall path just a few side effect that really werent to bad i lost a lot of weight because it suppressed my appetite it wa all weight that i could afford to lose and i feel better about myself i do however have to make a list of task before i begin my day or i just get super hyper focused on one thing for to long i grind my teeth and i have to take sleepaids but it worth it

3310,fluoxetine,i found this medication a bit difficult at first but my doctor told me it take week for the body to adjust to this so i held out am now on mg and each increase took a few week to get used to to anybody trying this medication and reading these review make sure the reviewer stayed on it for over day before posting because after three week it wa the best thing that ever happened to me i have energy and motivation i dont struggle to get out of bed it not hard to do my laundry i just do it it great
3311,alprazolam,i have had depression since i wa a teenager i have tried pretty much anything you could think of nothing ha helped me like xanax the problem is that doctor dont like to prescribe this medicine i feel so lost without it and i would only take it when i really needed it only or time a week

3321,xanax,excellent medicine for anxiety depression and insomnia
3322,adderall,i began taking adderall tablet mg off and on sometimes using ritalin tablet instead both medication although chemically different have been bad for my sex drive adderall wa preferable a it did not cause me to feel so emotionally vulnerable and weepy a ritalin but learning that there a neurotoxic impact from adderall that doe not occur with dexedrine ha made me ask the question why not dexedrine i do not enjoy the adderall high i always take every medicine a prescribed and vacation adderall helped me focus but felt physically mean now my psych doctor ha prescribed dexedrine er i look forward to enjoying sex again
3323,prozac,ive been on prozac for just about month at first i did not notice a difference for about a month then i started feeling more energized for a few week however the weight is going on a fast a grass grows im seeing my doctor today and need to switch ive even been working out walking and have been more active the weight gain is awful at least for me
3324,fluoxetine,i used to take cipralex for my anxietydepression and have recently switched to this a the cipralex did not work for me fluoxetine ha helped me with both depression and anxiety in a big way i still struggle with some depressive symptom but theyre manageable and im able to recognize anxiety for what it is rather than letting it cycle into so much negative selftalk that it contributes even more to depressive symptom overall ive had a great experience with this drug but recommend careful monitoring for any medication switch hang in there
3325,alprazolam,began taking xanax during a time when my one and only child left home for college and i lost my job a month later it allowed me to cope and move forward the most i ever took wa mg per day but i now take when i have periodic depression and anxiety i sometimes go week without taking one the best way to describe it is like rebooting your mind life saver for me
3326,prozac,in i wa miserable for no particular reason and wa diagnosed with depression and prescribed prozac great life depression in check in i weened myself off it because i didnt think i needed it anymore a luck would have it i hit a period of challenging event in life that they brain interpreted a trauma to cope i began drinking a little which evolved into daily i concluded that i had gone off prozac decreased self control and created a personal crisis im back on prozac and my mood have leveled off and i so far have the ability to abstain i wont go off it again

3329,xanax,if i could rate xanax higher i would this is without a doubt the most effective medication ive ever taken for anxiety and fast acting ive always dealt with the public speaking anxiety since high school im healthy and active and have never been depressed so thats why ive been reluctant about ssri my gp prescribed celxa went up to mg and it wa a nightmare had panic attack and very vivid intrusive thought my gp switched to lexapro mg and i still get panic attack if i get a panic attack i take a mg of xanax and it take like min to kick in and i feel great i hate ssri and wish xanax wa a daily med

3342,prozac,i wa prescribed this drug for panic disorder and wa on it for week i have never felt wise in my entire life i did bit eat or drink unless forced spiraled into depression and just wa not the excited loving person i normally am i world go home and state at the wall for hour then crawl into bed and sleep i had nightmare each night i felt dead and like i wa floating above my body my friend and teacher became more worried than before i had to get off that pill

3345,prozac,i have been on prozac for a month now i wa hesitant because i have tried antidepressant in the past and they did not agree with me i am shocked at how i am feeling i am calm my social anxiety that i thought wa more of a personality trait is gone i feel compelled to take care of myself i have energy i am happy like many i had a paralyzing fear of june bug i stupidly left my outside light on the other evening and came home to their swarm i unlocked the door and even swatted one away from my ear and walked in the house my heart rate didnt even increase i am a whole new person
3347,fluoxetine,i wa started on prozac mg earlier this week after trying lexapro previously and i have already noticed a huge difference before my anxiety and depression got to the point where it wa difficult for me to socialize or to feel like i wa quotall therequot felt like i wa always fighting through a dense fog the inability to concentrate wa exhausting this medicine feel like it is slowly but surely clearing that foggy feeling i am looking forward to the next few week a i wa told that is when it would reap it benefit entirely i would highly recommend
3348,adderall,very effective but very addictive you may not realize until you stop taking it what do you do it help the conditionbut you become dependent on the drug
3350,niravam,a must for anyone with panic attack work fast give you your life back
3351,fluoxetine,i have been taking prozac for two month the first month i did not notice a difference but after week i wa not obsessing or getting angry and noticed i wa more relaxed around other people being a shy person from the day i wa born i am still not interested in anymore social interaction however i have noticed that i am now extremely tired on the prozac which is debilitating and frustrating since i have an exam to write in day and have no motivation to study i have lot of energy when i am exercising so i dont think it due to low iron or nutritional deficiency went to doctor today and he recommended i stay on it for another month so the medicine normalizes in my body
3354,alprazolam,alprazolam ha allowed me to regain my social life i wa imprisoned in my own home by anxiety attack not able to spontaneously go out for a meal a movie etc now i can go out and not worry about having an anxiety attack it ha literally changed my life and i am very thankful for it
3355,alprazolam,i used to honestly be completely against pharmaceutical in every sense until i developed panic disorder i have intrusive thought and experience hypochondria and dissociation literally for hour on end or off and on throughout the entire day it nearly impossible to even live a normal life feeling this way after talking a mg xanax within minute all of those negative feeling start to dissipate it ha truly been a miracle drug for me and ha changed my life for the better
3356,amphetamine,evekeo ha been great for the first time i am doing a lot better in my school and i understand it better when it come off it smooth and i dont stay up all night i use the discount for my prescription and my insurance card and it is not that expensive but without all of that it definitely will be
3357,adderall,adderall ha made me successful at work it allows me to dominate i am the hardest worker i only want to work and get ahead but not socialize
3358,fluoxetine,i went on a course of mg per day for about year basically on advice from duty nurse this wa after telling her of mild anxiety low energy and low mood after about week my general moodpositive feeling and energy level were enhanced after approximataly year the effect wore off totally it is now month since i stopped i am now about to restart hopefully to get those positive mood back
3359,adderall,i began talking adderall about month ago i wa scared to say the least many people i talked to advised against taken the add med instead suggesting naturopathic med i wouldnt know where to start i have suffered from depression since i can remember started taking med for that in my early s looking back at my life a a child into my teen and adult year there wa no doubt in my mind that i also had adhd now year later i realized it wa time to do something about it dr started me off at mg then mg up to mg now it amazing how this stuff work i can actually concentrate and complete something the only complaint i have is that i am a little more spacey could be because im a mother of though
3360,alprazolam,ive tried many other nonaddictive medication and none of them helped my anxiety the way xanax doe after several other medication and hesitation on my part my doctor finally prescribed me xanax mg time daily depending on my level of anxiety that day i ended up breaking most of the pill in half and only taking mg usually x a day and find it relief my anxiety without the level of sleepiness a whole mg give me i usually only take a whole pill if i feel a panic attack coming on but ill take the mild drowsiness any day over the level of constant anxiety i had prior to starting the drug and a couple cup of coffee usually doe me good i can definitely tell when a dose start to wear off though some withdrawal
3361,adderall xr,with no medicine i am the world laziest housekeeper no kidding with ritalin i am still that but i do very well at work i tried adderall because it wa cheaper and it didnt help my concentration at work but i painted the floor and the entire inside of my house a complete renovation needed no sleep almost at all while it great to be so productive physically i have to try something else because i feel like im on full throttle
3362,fluoxetine,this is my third medication ive tried for my anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder i wa first on fluvoxamine and klonopin and those did nothing but make me a zombie a month into prozac while i wa feeling the side effect of dizziness and whatnot everything just turned back on literally it like someone turned the light on all i can say is it take time dont be discouraged also pay attention to what you take with it i wa on zoloft and wa getting extremely dizzy prozac doesnt agree with certain medication and definitely not caffeine for the most part though i went from having panic attack so bad they felt like heart attack to being completely calm and quotnormalquot
3363,alprazolam,ok ive been diagnosed with depression insomnia insomnia induced night terror agorphobia and major anxiety disorder i wa first put on klonopin which took care of everything except my depression my psychiatrist first put me on to try different ssrisnris along with my klonopin lexapro zoloft cymbalta and wellbutrin made my depression worse so finally he put me on xanax mg x daily along with my klonopin mg x daily and i finally feel normal again xanax is a great medication overall
3364,fluoxetine,started taking this a week ago for moderate depression and anxiety ive been on zoloft and paxil before but the zoloft made me exhausted and the paxil made me gain weight and missing dos caused quotbrain zapsquot like mini electric bolt i felt better the very first day and i knew the exact moment it came on even a coworker noticed my smile wa like nothing before every day thereafter my mood ha been amazing my doctor told me to start with mg and then mg after a week but i jumped right into the mg because i know my tolerance for medicine i still have some social anxiety so he may bump me to mg next visit but right now even at this dosage i feel like life is worth living and is manageable
3365,fluoxetine,i had been on celexa for year which caused weight gain low motivation sleepiness and my anxiety came back full strength now week on prozac and i feel like myself again high energy good appetite alert no anxietybasically i feel great i wa drinking alcoholic beverage a day now i am not interested in drinking more than a day i am over and my vision wa beginning to slip when reading item close up ever since i started prozac my vision ha improved and i can see thing le than inch from my face not sure why that happened but it did give it a tryyou will get your life back
3366,amphetamine,do not take this it caused my yr old grave mental issue
3367,xanax,i wa prescribed xanax in when i started college at age have panic disorder anxiety disorder and ptsd dosage ha always been mg daily im completely a different person with it no more stuttering no more panic attack and running out if class to hide ive never had to increase the dose since i could never gave gotten through year of college without it
3368,fluoxetine,i started taking prozac in i actually wa suicidal and depressed in but the kind of treatment prescribed wa to see a shrink which i didnt talk to i tried to kill myself unsuccessfully many time i just didnt want to live anymore a very terribly sad feeling of not belonging even in family gathering in i started mg of prozac first week wa greati wa very energetic and i didnt feel like eating but after that it evened out and i felt better i then went up to mg two year ago i started pulling my hair out went up to mg but wa too much and my doc kept me on mg i still cant stop pulling my hair out doe prozac cause this ocd i thought it wa supposed to help it
3370,adderall xr,wellbutrin did nothing for me and strattera caused erectile dysfunction and significant sleep disorder my doctor slowly increased my adderall xr dosage until i hit the quotsweet spotquot which wa mg for me mg made me a little jittery and anxious in the correct dosage adderall ha improved my quality of life with no side effect i should note that if i miss a day i am fine but any longer without it and i become lethargic so remember to refill your prescription a soon a you can so you dont run out i take the generic of this drug and it work great
3371,alprazolam,i am prescribed mg tablet a month brand name i take a half time a day and am also prescribed mg klonopin a month morning afternoon and night while the klonopin seems to aid in keeping the panicanxiety at bay and keeping me calm and relaxed the xanax is the real punch to panic attack and anxiety it take all my sadness and depression away and allows me to think about all the amazing thing i am working on not a a chore or a work but a creative idea being prescribed benzos is odd practice like klonopin time a day with a fast acting xanax
3372,fluoxetine,ive been hesitant try prozac a i didnt want to be a zombie or overly sedated but after year of dealing with panic disordergeneralized anxiety and countless antidepressant not working i decided to give it a try the first month wa pretty rough i wa always tired brain wa foggy and i continued to have anxiety but i stuck with it and after increasing to mg i felt absolutely normal i could feel emotion and even a normal amount of anxiety without freaking out it ha also helped with social anxiety downside i find it almost impossible to get any deep sleep on this medicine and no sleep medicine seems to work ive tried them all
3373,prozac,i had a horrible experience with prozac i wa actually very excited when my doctor decided it would be the next antidepressant medication i tried because it get so much good publicity hell there even a memoir called quotprozac nationquot upon beginning my daily regimen of prozac i had increased anxiety too the point that i wa having uncontrollable heart palpitation dizzy spell trouble breathing i couldnt eat and got down to lb on accident and my suicidal ideation increased to the point that i made a very serious suicide attempt thanks to quick intervention speedy response from paramedic and a life flight i am alive today be careful and be aware of side effect
3374,xanax,this is the best to knock a panic attack flat on it arse i been taking mg daily for month and i also take them when i fly i could literally walk on the wing and not care dont take with alcohol thoughi made the mistake of popping one of these then drank or martini i made a fool of myself and swung from a coworkers chandelier at a party and pulled it out of the ceiling everyone wa cheering me on so i felt like a bru the more i drank the stupider i became at the end of the night i climbed a street pole and tried to punch out the light telling people it wa a ufo they work well but do not drink on them
3375,alprazolam,i am prescribed to take two xanax a day but in reality i only take it when i am having a panic attack or feeling very tense or unhappy it work better for anxiety and tension then it doe depression a far a i can tell but then again i dont take it consistently
3376,alprazolam,i started taking xanax at age and it wa a great medicine i had such bad panic attack and just constant anxiety i started out on a low dose and within min i felt calm and fine i got from the place of not being able to walk outside or answer the phone to being able to get married have a job go on vacation anything i wanted to do i wa normal but now im and on the highest dose mg a day and about year ago my horrible anxiety came back even though im taking it i cant work drive or really go anywhere anymore so i guess id say it work but then you may build up a tolerance and then it wont work

3388,xanax,the fastest acting anti anxiety medication ive ever been prescribed and by far the most effective the anxiety i experienced prior to medication wa crippling i would stay in bed all day and not want to leave my house to go to school or anything that involved other social interaction this medicine got me up happy and willingwanting to do the thing i could not do before however through prolonged use of this medication i have a a result become addicted a when i do not receive my scheduled dose i feel withdrawal overall this medication ha done so many good thing for me i would be content taking this until the end of time for the pro outweigh the con tenfold
3389,alprazolam,this med helped me to go back to a stressful job after am so grateful to have had this to deal with stressi wa able to function not get panicked or be exhausted by the stressful work in a hospitalmg per day wa so helpful
3390,prozac,i had been on prozac for three year and gone through a lot of hard time it helped when i wa splitting from my ex lost a job got into some legal trouble lost my license and had to move back home after getting back on my foot again and getting my license and a job i decided to ween off of itbad ideai became more and more stressed out and had very bad stomach issue that i never had before after about three month off mg a day i had a huge panic attack and day of not eating or sleeping i have since gone back on mg and hope it start to work soon i should have never gone off this medication it saved my life once and i hope to have the same result again i wa happy able to take thing much better and be myself
3391,prozac,i am a different person when im on this and in a good way it help me keep stable the first time i wa on it i got really sick and felt terrible i tried it again on a lower dose and built my way up and now im doing well on it
3392,xanax,ive just switched to klonopin from being on xanax for almost year it worked wonder for me i never abused it and take it responsibly but i did develop a tolerance to it after so long on it one of the best thing about xanax is that it kick in pretty quickly which is a must for panic attack it very hard for me to let xanax go because it the only thing that really worked for my anxiety and panic attack
3395,adderall,this ha helped me a lot but i have a couple tip there are different brand that people will react differently to i thought they would all act the same but no i had a bad reaction with the first generic brand i tried tried a different generic brand and had a better experience so look into that because not everyone belief that there such a difference between different brand but to me there wa second im overweight and thought quotdecreased appetite goodquot but i would advise to still make sure youre eating frequently enough food ha such an impact on brain functioning so not eating for hour because you didnt feel like it is a bad habit to start once i got those slight issue settled this drug really be smart
3396,adderall,work well to reduce symptom of adhd
3398,alprazolam,i wa before experiencing anxiety it happened when i quit smoking pack a day if i smoked the anxiety stopped i wanted to quit smoking very badly i quit month ago i take dose of alprazolam a needed usually twice a day no side effect i could not have quit smoking without it hopefully i can wean off the alprazolam gradually over time
3401,fluoxetine,it took a few month for it to start to settle in i think but total game changer month ago i wa in an awful state due to undiagnosed ocd amp depression started going to therapy and taking prozac and now it feel like im standing on more solid ground i havent felt this good in year and feel silly for my past apprehension at trying ssri only side effect ive noticed are im a bit sleepy throughout the day and im having vivid dream most night never remembered my dream before taking prozac but no complaint about the latter recently bumped up to mg after being on for a few month to try and kick the last of the obsessive thought really couldnt recommend enough i can only hope this keep working
3402,xanax,ive been taking various dos of xanax for about year more quotonquot than quotoffquot but it ha been a god send i developed severe ptsd during military service which wa exacerbated by multiple sexual assault in civilian life and later military duty without this medication i dont know how i would have been able to function all these year if you take xanax do not attempt to combine it with prozac i took it and ended up in er having a status panic episode quotadrenaline stormquot which i wouldnt wish on anybody the prozac wa decreased and the xanax increased i havent been able to successfully go back down to the previous low level dosage yet but were hopeful i got my life back the first day i took xanax and have been doing well with it since
3403,xanax,starting on dosage and ha helped my anxiety enormously have to say that ha also helped my depression a well i got my st good noghts sleep in month help with panic attack a well i think sleep depravation play a major role in scattered thought and feeling of hopelessness once we start getting back to regular sleep pattern we can all feel sane and le overwhelmed in our everyday life good luck to all
3405,xanax,great for anxiety however only recommend using short term ive gone through opiate withdrawing a well a benzo withdraws and benzo withdraws are far worse never felt more suicidaluse with caution
3406,alprazolam,lost what i typed time in a row xanax is awful completely blacked out wasted all my fire wood cooking a terrible meal ended up with food everywhere and half of it missing and came to several hour later the rest of these pill are in the bin worst drug experience of my life
3407,xanax,i have emphysema related anxiety and xanax is the only thing that help me it doe not get rid of the anxiety attack but is strong enough to manage getting my anxiety attack under control the quality of my life is unbearable without this medication
3408,prozac,just wanted to share my experience woke up in the middle of the night week ago with a massive panic attack that i thought wa a heart attack went to the er two night in a row because they just wouldnt stop saw my doctor the next day and wa diagnosed with general anxiety and panic disorder wa prescribed mg prozac fluoxetine first week wa horrible almost all my symptom increased couldnt eat lost my sex drive it now a week in and i cant even tell you how much better i feel everything is back to normal eating like crazy sex drive is back this drug is a miracle it will probably worsen your symptom at first but think of it a an investment and keep pushing through and you should feel better hope this help anyone
3410,alprazolam,xanax alprazolam ha been a miracle for me i suffer from depression severe anxiety from gad panic disorder ocd and ptsd xanax help prevent panic attack and stop them once they start be careful about taking it everyday due to tolerance being built up to the medicine needing more and more to get the same effect and because of addiction issue i dont take regular xanax everyday i try to stick with the extendedrelease version if possible to avoid addiction to regular xanax regular xanax however work hard and fast and is great for those who really need it i give it a
3412,fluoxetine,ive been on and off prozac for the last few year i didnt think it wa working but after i started taking mental note i realized that i wa doing much better on it i have been dealing with chronic anxiety and ptsd which ha in turn led me into depression based on my experience i think it important to note that depression lifting is not like flipping a switch it take time for the medicine to work now that ive been taking it routinely and not missing a dose ive noticed that my quotbaselinequot mood is much better it happens subtly like a thick fog slowly lifting i understand that it doesnt work for everyone but if youre not having side effect and youve only been on it for a short time be patient and give it a chance
3414,fluoxetine,i have been on prozac for about month i started on mg and wa moved up to mg when i wa still reporting anxiety i have had panic and heavy anxiety attack for over year and finally decided i wa done suffering at first i wa very nervous about starting the medication but once it kicked in about week into taking the mg i wa convinced that i needed to take this medication i obviously have some disorder that ramp up my body and creates physical sensation that are not quotnormalquot since being on mg i am feeling a ton better and i can not pin point any drawback thus far sexually i have no issue so far and aside from a momentary spaced out feeling i feel great
3415,fluoxetine,ive been taking the med for about about month now and i can honestly say i first i wa so happy i felt like my live had purpose more chatty a before i suffered form major depression where i didnt leave me bed in month and constantly tired to kill myself but i could see everything much clearer but i got too over happy on this drug and by about week of taking it i felt depressed for a week but i carried on taking it i went to the doctor a one day i wa really happy and the other day i wa really unhappy and threw taking the medication i wa they diagnosed with manic depression bipolar disorder worst thing i ever done
3416,fluoxetine,i have always been a huge stressor ever since i had my first son i wa and after i had him i suffered from postpartum depression i would cry all the time and started suffering from panic attack shortly after i did not try antidepressant until i wa about then started zoloft took an edge off but no relife of anxiety today i am still a sufferer of stress and depression been taking prozac mg for month huge difference my husband say he can tell i dont have outburst and i only cry when i should not at the drop of a hat i try not to stress over little thing and just had the best christmas ever because i did not think of suicide like i have in the past i wa actually happy and thankful to be here

3435,adderall,im year old and ive been on adderall for week now and ive experienced some side effect one of them would be loss of appetite especially in the morning and around lunch ive already gone from being to thats not natural my friend ha the same problem too i prefer adderall though because my doctor told me that vyvanse last for hour and if you take it at or on the weekend then you cant sleep till or in the morning adderall doesnt cause insomnia if you take it at because it only last for hour adderall really help me pay attention in school which is why im not failing out of my quotcollege prep schoolquot totally recommend adderall
3437,fluoxetine,i went on prozac several month ago after having been severely depressed for over a year straight with a few day here and there of hypomania it made a huge difference im only on milligram but i am a lot le depressed and more productive than i wa the only downside is that i am still having some bad mood swing but overall it ha helped my depression a lot
3438,alprazolam,work great for me when i use it on a quotper attackquot basis my doctor put me on it time a day and that will make it ineffective i only take it when i feel my heart starting to race and within to minute i am back to normal
3439,alprazolam,tinnitus very loud and last all day and night couldnt sleep until i used xanax and it worked great
3440,prozac,ive been depressed for most of my life but wa raised to quottough it outquot i am a recovering opioid addict so i am scared to take any medication at all the last year ive completely withdrawn from any social activity relationship amp have just been doing the bare minimum to get by recently my oldest son turned amp ha severed tie with me this took me to the lowest low ive ever been amp made me suicidal for the sake of my younger son i chose to get help i wa put on mg of prozac amp have been on it for week i wish i would have done this sooner through my recovery from opioids ive learned that pill are not the answer so these combined with counseling is the solution ive needed for a long time i hope this help others
3441,alprazolam,i live in the uk where it is virtually impossible to get xanax or any benzodiazepine so i am very lucky to have found a good doctor to prescribe it i am year old and the last year of my life were a living hell i have bpd and a very severe anxiety disorder that left me having multiple daily panic attack breakdown and even suicide attempt every doctor told me in the uk we get talking therapy and an ssri for anxiety but never benzos so i suffered on for year and year until month ago i found a dr who prescribed me xanax alprazolam mg time a day mg if needed and it is a miracle drug to me for the first time in my life i live without the constant crippling anxiety i highly recommend this med

3444,prozac,i wa going through a breakdown and eating healthy and working out but still life wa a mess and i couldnt cope so my pcp prescribed this to get me through i lost a bunch of weight fine because i wa a tad chunky and became numb to so many thing but i wa able to cope better and i had a bunch of energy i couldnt sleep but it wa okay with my hour work week it wa hard to concentrate on my medical study because i would get confused a lot but overall i adjusted and i would get on it again getting off it wa smooth
3446,fluoxetine,for the first few month the medication wa very successful in term of giving me the energy and quotdrivequot to get out of bed and do something with my day however there are sexual side effect a climax became near impossible this wear off with time both the energy and the sexual side effect after my body became accustomed to the medication i lost the extra energy and i became sexually quotfunctionalquot again after approximately month my depression returned and wa accompanied by severe anxiety a condition i had never dealt with before ive since stopped taking prozac and noticed significant improvement in my overall life my experience with prozac wa that it good in the short term but not for the long haul
3447,xanax,i have used xanax for the past year for moderate to severe panic and or anxiety attack were it not for this drug i am not sure what i would have done it wa and still is a god send i only use it a needed a opposed to daily use two downside are that it make me drowsy and if i drink alcohol when i have taken it i get very testy dont drink and drive and dont drive while on xanax
3449,alprazolam intensol,saved my life i didnt know i had anxiety doctor kept giving me high blood pressure medication only finally went to a psychiatrist he gave me xanax and tofranil xanax helped a lot the antidepressant i had problem with sleeping mostly been on xanax for year and the only medicine that really help my panic attack
3451,alprazolam,ive had vertigo for three year now due to a head injury this cause inner ear damage and i have chronic dizzy spell i have tried every medication out there and wa introduce to xanax at a urgent care clinic bingo finally i found something that work it also the only medication that help me sleep i dont know what id do without it addicting but at least i can make it better with xanax
3452,prozac,i went on prozac several month ago after having been severely depressed for over a year straight with a few day here and there of hypomania it made a huge difference im only on milligram but i am a lot le depressed and more productive than i wa the only downside is that i am still having some bad mood swing but overall it ha helped my depression a lot
3453,prozac,i have been dealing with major depressive disorder for year of my life along with ptsd and severe anxiety i have been on so many different medication for depression and have found that prozac is the only antidepressant that work for me i have been a low a mg now currently on mg i am considering going to mg i have to see how i feel in the next number of day i have been on this medication steadily for month or so i do have face twitch but they are very minor and dont come very often it really doe help me get out into the world and not be so affected by thing emotionally it crucial to my well being and emotional state and ha prevented me from hurting myself for a long time
3454,adderall xr,it help with everyday activity and i stay attentive and more focused
3456,fluoxetine,when i first started taking this medication i changed from lovan and for about week i felt on top of the world i wa motivated full of energy and wa actually laughing after a long period of depression it wa all downhill from there i reached the point where my brain just didnt feel quotrightquot i wa more depressed than ever feeling desperate and looking for a way out of feeling so low i stopped taking the medication initially to piss off my husband and it wa then that i realized this medication wa the cause of my depressive mood anxiety and anger i would not recommend this medication to anyone without close psychiatric monitoring
3457,xanax,only benzodiazepine that worked completely been on all the others have tried antidepressant with negative result so at the correct dose alprazolam is what i consider the hardest working anxiety and stress reliever available
3458,fluoxetine,i have been on mg fluoxetine for about year now due to depression and my temper it ha been of little help on my depression and temper
3459,prozac,prozac worked wonder for my anxiety and mild depression i always struggled with pmsrelated anxiety but after some big life change morning anxiety wa more and more frequent and my motivation and drive to accomplish anything wa low i didnt want to get out of bed even though nothing wa wrong with my life i just had an overarching feeling of hopelessness went to the doctor and she prescribed mg had bad nausea the first two week then it went away but i wa still struggling with anxiety some morning she bumped me up to mg and although it only been a few day i can totally tell a difference im more motivated happy and content no anxiety no nausea grateful for this med i feel good for the first time in awhile
3460,adderall xr,i use adderall xr mg at morning wake up for narcolepsy and find it effective it help like nothing else to start a day off quotawakequot a can be i am also prescribed mg ir taken twice throughout the day a needed a well a nuvigil armodafinil mg at night right before sleep balancing med is vital for this disease but back to the point adderall xr is amazing
3461,xanax,i started having panic attack year ago when going through death in the family and the ending of my marriage to being a single mom i just could not cope with it any longer i cant tell you the trip to the er just to be gave a lorazepam my doctor tried other benzos but they just did not help the sudden attack they have upped my dose but at this point xanax is a life saver and i dont know what i would do without them the only draw back is the half life they wear off to soon and i will not take another dose until time to take it again those few hour are not good but and milligram a day is far a i will take this i have been on benzodiazepine for three year and that scare me but not like the panic attack those make you feel like your having a heartattack or worse i have had some that i really did not think i wa going to live through so my xanax stay until i can get off them when the stress is gone and a taper off never suddenly go off them it could be very dangerous a taper down is best but from what i have heard it not pleasant
3462,fluoxetine,it work really well my mood and depression are better my only possible complaint is a constant upset stomach
3463,fluoxetine,i started off with mg for the first week and noticed that i have finally been able to get some sleep before hand i could never get sleep and never had energy throughout the day im more friendly i wa starting to spend more time with my husband being more intimate and just feeling good for the second week i started to notice my body want to shut down by pm which i love i could wake up am for work and have so much energy to get what i need done i do not really have racing thought anymore sometimes i catch myself still being sad from time to time but thats only be because it take about a month to have the full effect fair to say i did notice positive improvement im glad that i got help when i did
3465,alprazolam,i have anxiety amp used valium first to help anxiety a well a sleep dr started me with mg x a day for year it helped but then i built up a tolerance and then mg x a day wa fine and worked but notice a tolerance again so then after year changed me to alprazolam and wow big difference i wa prescribed mg stick x a day a month at first only need a day then shortly im on pill mg a day and no side effect powerful at first now almost fell like i need more but wanted to cut down it been year in benzos and keep hearing about withdrawal from the drug i go a week sometimes without the drug and dont feel any symptom any suggestion
3466,fluoxetine,i wa told that antianxiety med take a while to kick in but i feel like this one ha kicked in sooner than i thought it would i only take mg for anxiety and overall i have started to feel a lot more positive and le stressed out about thing i usually stress out about i havent noticed any side effect besides my stomach feeling a little off the first week and lately i have not been a hungry a i usually am and get full alot fasterbut i wake up in the morning starving weird but no headache or trouble sleeping or anything i hope i can continue to take this medicine because it doe seem to keep me quotlevelquot with my emotion
3467,prozac,i started on mg of prozac for gad the first two week have been hell insomnia nausea vomiting weight loss and anxiety the side effect seem to be subsiding now more balanced than before
3468,alprazolam,i use this a needed for limited symptom panic attack i take mg and every so often i take an extra half two three four time a week it a wonder drug although im sure you could get dependent if you took them every day
3469,xanax,very good a little drowsiness after panic subsides though im not sure if this is due to a physiological response to subsiding high level of hormone associated with fightflight response cortisol and adrenaline involved in panic attack
3470,prozac,i have been taking prozac mg for about a month i went through a divorce last year which wa stressful and still is i wa staying stressed out cried a lot had a negative attitude and wasnt sleeping i went to my doctor and she prescribed prozac to take every morning and ambien which is only ha needed it took about day but i can tell a difference i dont feel all stressed out anymore i handle problem and situation better i havent cried at all since taking it not sure how i feel about that i just kinda feel like im on an evenkeel so to speak havent had any real side effect from the prozac i like taking it and will probably stay on it for a while
3471,adderall,i have bipolar disorder and have add not adhd for which i wa on ritalin methylphenidate my doctor switched me to adderall because my concentration seemed to be waning again but i dont believe it is working a well concentration is about the same but it seems i am experiencing a lot more anxiety now than i did with the ritalin
3472,alprazolam,this drug is awesome i have been suffering from anxiety attack for about year now they come out of nowhere even when im calm i take the lowest dose of xanax which is mg and i am normal again in minute and most of the time i usually dont have to take another one for the rest of the day all of the rest of the drug out there have horrific side effect and make you feel awful but not this one i only take it when i need it

3482,xanax,i have suffered from a very severe anxiety and panic disorder all of my life i wa given xanax about a year ago because the medication i wa taking were not working i started taking the xanax which did take care of the panic attack for the most part but what i did not realize is that though i wa taking the dosage that the doctor had prescribed to me i wa blacking out and getting very violent or i would be asleep my eye would open i would punch my boyfriend in the face and try to choke him then go back to sleep like nothing even happened the morning after these event he would wake up on the couch and tell me what i had done i did not remember doing any of this it wa terrifying

3489,prozac,i have depression prozac did not help me after week and several side effect the only positive experience wa the fact that i didnt feel anything quotbadquot or quotgoodquot the worst wa the major lack of motivation and loss of all interest in what i enjoyed in life that wa kind of the problem before the medicine this is my second day off prozac and i feel better each day good luck all

3494,xanax,this is the best medicine out there it make me a better person i love it i have anxiety and depression and this is the only thing that make me tolerable to be around level me out and make me happy
3496,mydayis,i switched to mydayis from vyvanse the effect of mydayis last longer than vyvanse but just asmdashin my experiencemdashvyvanse did not last fourteen hour mydayisrsquos duration of action fall short of the sixteen hour a advertised by shire nonetheless i still hold mydayis superior to vyvanse and adderall
3497,prozac,prozac is my happy pill it took me forever to find something that work but this is definitely mine i wa beginning to be skeptical that anything would work effexor and prestiq wa what i wa put on before this and that wa a nightmare this make me think more clearly and see thing in a different perspective i see the good in life and i dont get so easily upset over everything anymore and if i do get bothered by something i get over it in second help with my social anxiety a well ive noticed im more talkative and can deal with being around people better before i wa so badly depressed with possible bipolar or personality disorder im finally getting to know myself a a person and am much happier now

3504,alprazolam,on mg with mg escitalopram at day time and mg clonazepam at sleep nice medicine and completely drive away my anxiety especially the running heartbeat and sweaty palm using also propranolol mg for social anxiety disorder and racing thought would rate it if my concentration in studying would not have decreased due to one of above mentioned medicine overall good taking it since past month
3505,fluoxetine,i got severe depression in college had it in high school a well and took some antidepressant that started with an l i really cant remember i started taking prozac my nd year in college after my girlfriend broke up with me it helped tremendously overcome the loneliness the only problem ive ever had with it is my rem sleep i didnt take my pill for day over spring break this past week and had the worst panic attack ive ever had in my life i thought i wanted to die it wa the worst car ride i have ever experienced a soon a i took my prozac everything wa better i trust this
3506,xanax xr,i take it at night in order to sleep because of a bad insomnia side effect from a maoi but now if i miss just one night of the med i wake up with paralyzing anxiety chest tightness and heart palpitation this drug doe it job most of the time but it creates physical and psychological dependency and an am hangover i am looking to wean off of this soon once my new psychiatrist introduces other med change i see other user below saying they cut them in half my psychiatrist said that is dangerous because of the xr property that is why the xr pill are not scored i repeat regular use of this med creates dependency
3507,prozac,amazing effective medicaction work like magic make me relax and happier and enhanced my sexual drive very safe and i love it overall this medication changed my life and enhanced everything and helped me function in a very short time that i stopped taking it

3509,alprazolam,ive been on and off xanax for year it the only drug that make me feel normal after a lifetime of anxiety and depression it awful that people use it recreationally and thats made it difficult to get a prescription for it because of others abuse of it it make me feel normal so obviously i need it i have nothing but good thing to say about this drug it help me not want to freak out and shake due to anxiety if you really need to be on it it amazing
3512,alprazolam,truly a miracle pill starting have severe anxiety attack out of nowhere heart palpation numbness in arm and leg dizzy tremor and with to min i feel normal again i would advise to only take when desperately need to because i can see how they can become addictive i take mg but will start to cut that in half a lower dosage is always better if it work i have only been taking for one week so far so good and no side effect to report
3513,fluoxetine,im and ive had anxiety and some bad panic attack for the past year im prescribed ativan lorazapam to take a needed it helped a lot for traveling and definitely for shutting down panic attack but it also give you a lot of ups and down it a benzo so it essentially just shuts you down and make you pas out it doesnt really help fix the problem i talked to my doctor this summer about getting on an every day anxiety medicine and my mom take prozac so i thought maybe itll help me too i started at for a month and then increased to for month i can honestly say i havent had bad side effect at all but also it just felt like it wasnt doing anything i just recently increased to this month hoping for the best
3515,prozac,ive been on fluoxetine mg for only day i have noticed some change already i have the worst anxiety and for the past day stressful situation seem a tad bit le stressful for me i already lost pound on it it make me never think about food anymore it make me not hungry for hour even a small granola bar can keep me satisfied and full for hour but i force myself to have breakfast lunch and dinner thing seem more brighter color are more vivid to me overall i think it starting to work i will rerespond in a few week to touch base

3517,alprazolam,i have taken xanax for many year at a safe daily dose i started in with mg three time daily having severe anxiety attack while my dad wa losing his battle with cancer a the year progressed and i realized i have a big social anxiety issue i stayed on xanax i couldnt function socially without it last year i wa diagnosed with meniere disease which cause daily vertigo spell and constant roaring in my ear my doctor increased my xanax to mg three time daily a it help with these symptom not long ago i wa diagnosed with clinical depression i wa put on celexa but am hating the side effect i took myself off zoloft twice in the past because of the side effect xanax ha truly been a life saver for me
3519,adderall xr,many doctor seem to be convinced that if you have an ad disorder you simply cant get high on stimulant medication this is not the case at all first off stimulant medication in general work well very very well the first day i took adderall i wa at school about an hour after i took my dose of mg i started to feel this awake alert energetic feeling inside i liked a lot for the next hour all of my boring subject became very interesting and i became a very social person after about a month those effect started to go away i went to the doc and asked for a dose increase without any hesitation he doubled my dose to mg i quickly found my self abusing adderall year later and im now in rehab for drug abuse
3520,prozac,ive been using mg of prozac daily for almost a year now i went from the worst ive ever been cry all the time never being able to stop thinking about how much i hated myself life and everything about life i wa not eating wa so full of rage and hate and had the most negative mindset towards everything like every second of my life wa hell and pointless seeming i wished i wa dead although would never actually kill myself for my family sake and after about or week of taking the prozac everything got so much better it wa like it flipped a switch in my head and the negative thought went away and i actually felt good and happy which i thought wa so impossible to feel taking these med wa the best thing ive ever done
3521,fluoxetine,my period wa late for week besides that it is working for me
3524,prozac,originally my doctor prescribed me klonopin antianxiety medicine and i took it for a year and started to feel very slow i had a very blunt expression on my face and my family started to begin to think i wa depressed i saw another doctor and he prescribed me prozac it ha relieved much of my depression and anxiety i smile more and i think a bit clearer now i dont worry all the time and i actually feel worth something the first week you dont see much improvement but once you hit month you start to feel a lot better at least i did however there are some sexual side effect and you can feel drowsy
3525,fluoxetine,i wa on mg for a few year which worked well still had some stressful period with relationship issue i then went to mg and i kinda felt more confident the stress proof feeling some people say this is only a placebo effect but it not entirely drawback are slight zombie feeling sometimes and probably a bit more restless but normally result in me getting more work done my doctor said to try to go down to mg when i varied the dose i had a cold and some work stress at the same time and it wasnt very good i would recommend having some psychologist support for changing dos you need a proper plan my family doctor didnt really give me a plan
3527,alprazolam,take away anxiety and panic attack very well
3528,xanax,i have had tremendous benefit from just mg taken a needed i previously had lived with anxiety and panic from social situation particularly work meeting eating out at restaurant etc for about month before working up the courage to see my doctor i started developing avoidance tendency and decided that i wa tired of letting anxiety run my life i am careful to take it only a needed and would highly recommend for those with occasional severe anxiety or panic ive been exercising more and focusing hard on positive thinking and that combination with the occasional xanax ha been tremendous remember you have an awesome life to live
3529,fluoxetine,i had been having anxiety and other symptom such a weight loss i wa diagnosed with ocd and started on mg prozac i battled with side effect for the first month of increased anxiety nauseousness and sleeping problem at about the week mark the negative side effect went away and i started to feel some relief from the anxiety caused by the ocd i wa increased to mg which seems to be enough for me i have now been on it for over a year i feel so much better like a weight is lifted off of my shoulder and i no longer worry and ob i have gained some weight but the anxiety had made me lose weight so i think i am able to eat now because i feel better i dont sweat the small stuff in life anymore
3531,alprazolam,very addictive neurotoxin stop working after a few month withdrawal include problem like psychosis and dementia
3533,fluoxetine,i have been taking prozac for month and have constantly had to experience the tiredness it cause and lack of motivation i have now supplemented it with mg of wellbutrin and notice a huge difference i am more alert energetic can concentrate and want to get out of the house instead of lying around i can still feel the serotonin effect of prozac so it the best of both world
3534,adderall,i started on ritalin for adhd but i switched to adderall because the ritalin made me extremely irritable adderall mg allows me to concentrate tune out distraction and manage time efficiently negative side effect suppressed appetite positive for me sometimes slightly irritable mood towards the end of the day sleeplessness if i take it le than hour before bedtime
3535,prozac,i wa on this medicine for two week i felt fine even a little happier but for day straight i went into a major depression i have stopped taking it
3536,prozac,started of on mg for anxiety and depression didnt feel any different but felt irritated and snappy at everyone nurse practitioner just bumped me up to mg and i feel better and it only been week hopefully this will take the edge off so i can more enjoyable to be around
3537,alprazolam,excellent for anxiety especially if you start with the minimum amount mg and only take more if needed i say this because i wa prescribed mg x daily and dont need that much try to take the least amount and if that work dont take more since you can build up a slight tolerance over time my only concern is will i ever be able to be off of medicine i just wish there wa a natural cure for anxiety i hate being dependent on this
3538,alprazolam,i thought the anxiety and panic i felt wa normal i did not know any different with some reluctance i approached my doctor and wa shocked to find out i experienced out of symptom of panic attack anxiety on a semiregular basis once again i have had this feeling for so long i just did not know any different my life ha changed i can go to work shop go to church and family function without feeling the terrible anxiety that i had before i take mg per day depending on the day activity i have no idea why my brain would throw me into a panic over the smallest of thing but it did and alprazolam worked i would give it much more then a if possible i now only fear being without it it is truly life changing
3539,xanax,xanax ha been a lifesaver for me i wa getting it prescribed at mg x daily and my life wa a close to perfect a i can ask for i made it to work every day and wa able to concentrate at school i can honestly say that i wouldnt have made it through college without it the problem now is that not psychiatrist is willing to prescribe it to me they keep giving me abilify prozac vistaril and trazodone i guess they figure if i am like a zombie all day i wont complain
3540,xanax,i love xanax i wish i could take it daily but my doctor wont prescribe it to me for daily use because she doesnt want me to get addicted to it i only take xanax on rare occasion when i wa extremely distraught it made me feel better instantly ive only taken mg but that wa more than enough to make everything seem great i wa aware that my problem still existed but i wasnt overwhelmed by them it made me feel warm and happy ive taken other drug before and xanax is by far the best choice
3541,fluoxetine,i wa prescribed this for use with my clonazepam in treating my panic disorder i had three day of almost nonstop panic attack before i went to my doctor my doctor thought that there may be some depression a well and that the fluoxetine would work well with clonazepam if there wa any depression with my anxiety i took the medication for two month and noticed no advantage compared with clonazepam alone
3542,prozac,given my experience on this medication i should probably give it a quotquot but im going to give it a because of my initial response to it ive had depression for year and the symptom have never remitted which eventually lead to my choice to seek hospitalization last year however a week after i went on this medication my symptom were completely gone all of the cognitive impulse control and executive functioning deficit related to my partially remitted depression disappeared howeverthe medication made me manic in about a month i started experiencing paranoid delusion and had to admit myself to the hospital again im heartbroken that it didnt work for me but maybe it will work for others
3543,fluoxetine,i had the worst reaction to this medicine i wa on mg and my body rejected it terribly the first few day were fine and then after the th day or so i became very glazed over and out of it it wa a if i wa a walking zombie i then started waking up in the middle of the night having severe panic attack i had never had one before so i wa very scared my doctor told me to come off of it and the withdraw from this wa even worse i woke up in the middle of the night and had to go to the hospital overall i had a very negative experience but my mom take this medicine and she love it could just depend on the person i guess
3546,prozac,i wa suffering from extreme anxiety and panic disorder the smallest thing would lead to a full blown attack i couldnt sleep eat or care for my young son it wa crippling my doctor first prescribed ativan and something with and something else but i began feeling like a a zombie and wa sick i couldnt wake up i stopped taking the medicine after a few day and returned to the doctor worse off than before he then prescribed the prozac and i noticed difference within two day the anxiety wa le severe and completely gone within week side effect were drowsiness for the few week i have been on prozac now for month and we are going to begin weening off of it in the next month or two it wa a lifesaver in my eye
3547,prozac,my psychiatrist prescribed me prozac recently when he diagnosed me with generalised anxiety disorder and depression my depression and anxiety wa really bad i constantly worried about the same thing over and over again and couldnt control it got bad panic attack could not eat or sleep and became very depressed xanax helped me but only temporarily im taking prozac mg nearly two week now and already i feel like im getting back to myself i no longer worry im eating and sleeping better and panic attack are just a thing of the past the only side effect i have are increased appetite and fatigue but all i can say is that prozac is a god send that i would highly recommend it it ha helped me so much
3548,fluoxetine,i have been on prozac for about month and i must admit that it is a wonderful drug it help me control anger and anxiety issue that i have my only complaint is that i seem to get tremor but i could live with that
3549,xanax,dad always had some amount of general anxiety but managed it reasonably in approx he wa prescribed xanax after his dad died unexpectedly and he wa instructed to take x a needed he been on and off x ever since then and ha needed progressively more about year ago he quotgraduatedquot to other medication including antidepressant and at one point wa on a combo that resulted in a nearlysuccessful suicide attempt he never had suicidal thought before or after that particular combo he now old and his life is in ruin he take x throughout the day but is at the max and can not take more please be aware once you start on these medication youre in it for life drs know this job security for them
3550,prozac,ive been on every antidepressant known to mankind and they were awful to me either the side effect were too bad or it turned me into a complete zombie to the point work wa out of the question and then my dr said we would try one more called prozac and the reason he had not prescribed it before wa because it took week to reach full effect a where the others took le then half that time i started out taking mg because i have always been very sensitive to antidepressant and their side effect for about the first or week i experience light anxiety then finally the week passed and still nothing but then finally about week into the mediation i feel like santa clause on steroid it ha saved my life
3551,fluoxetine,i have been taking fluoxetine for month and it the best thing i have done it ha helped me get through a bad time i have had some bad day but i do have more good one and i have just gone back too work which i dont think i would have if i didnt take them
3552,fluoxetine,this medication did not work for me at all it could possibly be because i dont metabolize ssri very well but i could not feel any sort of change when on this it helped a little with my minor ocd which i why i stayed on it for so long but after awhile it just triggered what my doctor said wa an underlying mood disorder because i started flip flopping between being content or even emotionless and being severely depressed this medication did not help me but im not going to say it wouldnt work for other people i just couldnt take the side effect
3554,prozac,i used to have horrible nightmare couldnt sleep sometimes because of vision in the dark occasional sudden bout of intense unjustified anger etc ive been on prozac more or le im not great about taking the pill for year now i probably average mgday over time if i stop taking it for several week i will notice the angry spell starting to come back etc and thats my cue that i need to start taking it again it ha been very helpful for me it not a cure all and maybe the high of life are not a frequent but they still come and id rather have that and contentment than the awful low no free ride but i enjoy my friend exercise family and relationship overall a godsend for me
3555,prozac,i have currently been on prozac for the past month and it ha been a miracle drug i wa having severe anxiety and panic attack every day i couldnt drive a car by myself for fear of having a panic attack and losing control i couldnt go anywhere by myself and i could not stay home alone i am a year old female and once i turned i developed debilitating anxiety i tried zoloft and lexapro and both drug made my anxiety and panic attack sky rocket before starting prozac i wa a mess my anxiety prevented me from functioning i could barely even go to class or work without having a panic attack i am currently taking mg of prozac and i am doing so much better it is amazing
3556,fluoxetine,i have been on prozac now for a while a i suffer from ocd and ptsd also i feel a if it ha made me crazier if thats possible some day i cant stop twitching feel full of energy and experience nausea other day my bone hurt i feel not fully awake and just odd keeping in mind that daily i have a high level of caffeine and smoke marijuana and not daily but weekly i drink quite a bit of alcohol i have noticed alcohol and prozac really dont mix but nevertheless i am still taking mg daily which i do not think is enough but then some day i want to stop taking it altogether i do not although prozac dos shouldnt be skipped but evidently the only word i can use to describe this drug is odd and weird and idk uugh
3557,prozac,i noticed a difference in the first week it wa a positive difference and then about three week later i began to feel how i felt again and i told my parent and i think that i need more than the mg that im on currently but overall i think this drug work very well and you need to find the correct mg for your body
3558,prozac,i wa on this medication for over week and it made me into an unemotional zombie my grandma literally passed away in front of me and i couldnt even shed a tear it helped get me moving around more but it wasnt really helping my depression i wasnt happy at all and my anhedonia still persisted also on top of all that prozac made me lose my libidosex drive even after i stopped taking it over week ago im scared my libidosex drive is never going to come back this is why i only rated this drug a
3559,xanax,this worked great for me until my doctor retired and the new doctor taking over patient wont prescribe it now ringing in ear is back in full force
3560,fluoxetine,i have been on fluoxetine for many year i tried to switch to another medication but found quickly most of them did not compare to fluoxetine the only other two medication i have been successful with were cymbalta mirtazapineand seroquel i took the seroquel with the fluoxetine but i stopped it about a month ago because of the weight gain and high risk of diabetes i have gone back to the mirtazapine in combination with the fluoxetine and it is working just wonderful i too have began to see what it is to live a life without so much sadness worry and obsessive and compulsive thought and not wanting to live anymore i wish all of you the very best of luck
3561,adderall,adderall ha been a blessing to me i take mg twice a day and my thinking ha become so much more clear i am now able to pay attention and absorb what is going on around me i have had no negative side effect except for an occasional night where it might take me an extra minute to fall asleep i still have a healthy appetite since taking adderall this medicine ha made my life so much better
3562,alprazolam,this drug is currently working for my anxiety that is blood pressure related i wa on clonazepam and that made me high and groggy but did not help anxiety xanax ha worked perfectly reduces my symptom and no high feeling the minute i get freaked and have racy thought panic it curb it then i can get on with my day i have not noticed any side effect and my friend and family have seen improvement
3563,xanax,no side effect besides drowsiness it put me at a calm to help me think clearer
3565,alprazolam,i have had tremendous benefit from just mg taken a needed i previously had lived with anxiety and panic from social situation particularly work meeting eating out at restaurant etc for about month before working up the courage to see my doctor i started developing avoidance tendency and decided that i wa tired of letting anxiety run my life i am careful to take it only a needed and would highly recommend for those with occasional severe anxiety or panic ive been exercising more and focusing hard on positive thinking and that combination with the occasional xanax ha been tremendous remember you have an awesome life to live
3567,fluoxetine,i started taking prozac on tuesday i wa very hesitant at first i guess that wa based on what i heard about dependency i wa severely depressed after a emotionally abusive relationship ended i also terminated my pregnancy my choice and on top of that i am the single mother of a smart energtic year old i guess everything wa weighing heavily on me all at once i had turned to marijuana i have a stressful job on top of everything else my issue involved worrying excessively overthinking every little thing cry spell sleeping on my day off i stopped doing thing i used to enjoy scary i never had any suicidal thought im a few day in felt jittery one day but thats done definitely progressing miracle
3568,prozac,after reading all the review i decided to try prozac i am extremely sensitive to medication and have been on many different antidepressant usually stopping due to side effect my dr gave me the liquid prozac so i could take a tiny amount and work my way up initially loss of appetite nausea slight dizziness tiredness weight loss i am week out and most side effect have improved i feel so much better anxiety is low to nonexistent clear thinking hope ha returned still dealing with grief from my mother death but i feel better equipped to handle it that is a miracle i take mg yes mg and when i go higher i cant tolerate the side effect

3591,fluoxetine,i donrsquot find a lot of positive story about antidepressant or i find story where people are taking the antidepressant the wrong way i wanted to share my experience a positive one irsquove had generalized anxiety disorder severe ocd and panic disorder for a long a i can remember my first memory of having an episode wa when i wa year old at my kindergarten interview i feel a though i wa born with the illness mentioned above right from the womb when i wa a child i wa extremely anxious had bad separation anxiety from my parent and had extreme ocd i wa just a kid and thought that the way i wa feeling is how all kid felt i didnrsquot realize that i wa different this went on and got even worse in middle school i began developing trichtilomania in middle school in high school i went from being a above student to failing every class within a couple of year i couldnrsquot leave the house my panic disorder and gad caused debilitating physical symptom i would be shaking when i had to leave the house i wouldnrsquot drink alcohol because i wa afraid of vomiting i wa suffering so much for my whole entire life with severe phobia fear and anxiety i prayed and prayed and prayed to god every night for it to go away i wa a year old living in a prison of her own mind it never went away every single day wa the worst day of my life i would wake up and the thought just started i never had a break my life wa exhausting i am of east indian background and my parent didnrsquot understand mental illness well it is very taboo in my culture i went to ton of doctor and they told me it wa just growing pain no doctor ever told me that maybe i should see a therapist i didnrsquot have any support when i wa i attempted suicide luckily the attempt didnrsquot work and i wa forced to go on medication i wa livid i wa so against antidepressant i wa so so so scared it felt unnatural my general practitioner put me on effexor i took it for almost week it helped me to not want to kill myself but it also made me gain ton of weight which made me depressed and it make me hear voice one evening a voice told me to choke my mom and i started freaking out and my parent drove me immediately to the hospital at the hospital i talked to a psych nurse who calmed me down and got me an appointment with a psychiatrist the next day this appointment and this psychiatrist saved my life and changed my entire life i want to really mention that you should not be going to a general practitioner for mental illness medication you should alwayshellipalways go to a psychiatrist no matter what if your gp is the only person you are seeing to help you manage your med for ocd anxiety etc that is the wrong move that is such a common mistake people are making you need a psychiatrist in order to get the med right please do not just go to your regular doctor yoursquoll be cheating yourself i went to the psychiatrist appointment the next day it wa the first time i had ever seen a psychiatrist i got into her room and we talked about everything my childhood my phobia my ocd she then brought my parent into the room to explain the whole situation to them and the fact that i have a chemical imbalance in my brain and that i have been suffering for way too long my parent were so supportive the doctor told me i wa on the wrong medication that i never should have been placed on effexor which is an snri and that i should be on an ssri considering my main problem is ocd and gad we talked a lot about it and she told me she would like to place me on prozac she said for me because my neural pathway have been the same for plus year that i would need a higher dosage of prozac especially for anxiety and ocd i see on this forum that so many people are on mg or mg for anxiety disorder you should be on mg at least do not be afraid to go higher people that say prozac or an ssri didnrsquot really do anything for their anxiety or ocd is because they are only taking a mg dose that is not an ocd dose mg for anxiety and ocd please up your dose use the medication really use it do not be afraid my doctor started me on mg eventually took me to mg and then i went back to mg yes the side effect are insane i wa nauseated i couldnrsquot sleep i wa shaking i had anxiety but she prescribed me ativan and said to use it until the prozac kicked in that the ativan would keep me comfortable until that happened donrsquot try to be a hero use your ativan or your xanax or whatever to stay a comfortable a possible i could write so much more but irsquoll conclude with this month after being on mg of prozac everyday i woke up one day and i wa cured yes cured i had no ocd i had no anxiety i no longer had fear or phobia i wa cured you have no idea how that day felt it wa like the first day of my whole entire life i woke up being the real me who is free spirited and isnrsquot afraid of anything i wa finally free i wa no longer a prisoner i didnrsquot even have to go to therapy i just woke up one day a brand new person from taking a high dose of prozac every single day do not go off of the antidepressant your ocd your anxiety depression etc will come back i would never dream or even think to come off of my antidepressant i have an illness that will return if i go off the medication because i have a brain disorder ocd is a brain disorder do not stop taking medication for your brain disorder do not try to fix your brain disorder with just a mg or mg dose own your medication be on it for life itrsquos been year since i have been cured if it wasnrsquot for prozac i would be dead you need a psychiatrist do not be afraid to take more than mg of prozac to treat panic attack etc i am on mg a day and my life is a ball it is so wonderful and so carefree do not stop the med be on the med for life

3621,prozac,ive taken prozac a few time starting at that st time wa a nightmare i literally lost time only remember cry all the timei dont even remember how long i took it but that wa yr ago so i wa deathly afraid to try it again til about yr ago that time it wa a lifesaver i felt my mood lift alot after a week then even more after a month these result lasted for several yr with some sexual side effect but le than with zoloft amp lexapro which also caused waking wired every hr after a few yr it felt like i wa on nothing at all so i switched to pristiq which again saved my life now im back to prozac but im sure it more about whats going on in my life nothing work without situation improving a well
3622,prozac,i have been on this medication for around year mg a day for ocd and depression it got me out of a very very deep hole got me back to work able to function got me back a a normal person u fortuantly i used alcohol and recreational drug aswell which made me riddled with anxiety and depression im clean and sober year now and am still on the prozac iv recently had a low episode and i wa self medicating with my prozac a and when i needed obviously this wasnt the greatest idea and this ha led me back to being depressed again but im back on mg of prozac a day i may feel like i have gone back to the begining of it all but i havent iv just had a little set back in my recovery all in all prozac for me is a life saver
3623,prozac,ive been depressed with high level of anxiety for ten year i tried several different medication and i finally settled with an antidepressant to help with sleep and also wa taking klonopin a day a well a trazodone at night for sleep for seven year so im really thinking i may be on all these medicine for life and maybe be put on disability so the doc finally put me on prozac it been month now and my anxiety ha gone way down i am le depressed i no longer worry about thing and am off trazodone and dont take klonopin anymore i have great dream and wake up every morning with happy song in my head and im much more social prozac ha just been a blessing probably saved my life a i had lost all hope
3624,fluoxetine,ive been taking this for approximately year started with mg then mg then mg im at a point where i know it help me but the side effect are increasing and im not sure if i should lower dosage or up it i also take xanax up to three time a day
3625,alprazolam,i suffered all my life from severe anxiety finally at i found a doctor who gave me alprazolam i could not leave the house without it and i did go on for year suffering i have been taking it daily for year now and i often wonder if i could stop but i also know my quality of life and my heart according to my doctor would be a problem
3628,xanax,ive been taking low dose mg xanax for a few year for social anxiety and occasional panic attack it excellent i take it a needed which i like it let me feel more in control i rarely take a full dose it very effective even in a lower dose it just let me keep anxiety under control so i can function well i never notice any major fogginess or anything with it either unlike other benzos ive taken like ativan just in moderation a little go a long way absolutely great medication for anxiety and occasional severe panic attack it ha completely helped me build my confidence up and get my life back
3629,adderall,i too have gone through my whole life with undiagnosed adhd and i have to say that i have lost so many year of my life both academically and personal ive been recently diagnosed with adhd and started ritalin i could not tolerate ritalin it made me feel like a zombie along with bad headache my md switched me to adderall and it ha changed my life i wish i would have sought help year ago but i wa too embarrassed to seek mental health help ive been on mg per day of adderall for month now and it worked great except that i think this dose is too low a i have to split the mg into two dos per day mg work great for me but the other mg i have to take doesnt do much for me
3630,fluoxetine,i wa prescribed fluox by my gp to treat what wa believed to be generalised anxiety disorder later confirmed a comorbid with avpd circa and my dose wa doubled in initially result were good significant reduction in anxiety and depression within a fortnight but by the drug wa ineffective and we doubled the dose which allowed me to function while still experiencing anxiety but came with incredible fatigue for medium term use fluox is an effective and ssri for depression and anxiety but in the long term is need to be supplemented or replace a you build tolerance
3632,alprazolam,i had panic attack in my entire life i went to a doctor and wa given xanax at half mg to take immediately and hr later it worked and i thought i would keep some handy for any possible future attack he prescribed mg pill time a day i looked it up on the internet and didnt like the information on addiction i went to my doctor when i got back home and he prescribed ativan i believe xanax should be used only when having a panic attack and not a a maintenance drug
3633,alprazolam,ive started to take xanax month ago then mg a day experienced a rapid heartbeat at first but chose to give it a chance anyway and after week it wa back to normal now i take xanax and bupropion mg a day for my depression and anxiety i can tell it really ha changed my life so far i can feel joy or calmness again before i couldnt at all i hope to get back to normal soon cant even describe how im glad ive started to take these medication although i know many people have severe side effect the thing is it very individual you have to try and find a medicine that work best for you many people take prozac but i almost died when took it side effect were terrible i even experienced hallucination
3634,fluoxetine,ive been depressed for most of my life but wa raised to quottough it outquot i am a recovering opioid addict so i am scared to take any medication at all the last year ive completely withdrawn from any social activity relationship amp have just been doing the bare minimum to get by recently my oldest son turned amp ha severed tie with me this took me to the lowest low ive ever been amp made me suicidal for the sake of my younger son i chose to get help i wa put on mg of prozac amp have been on it for week i wish i would have done this sooner through my recovery from opioids ive learned that pill are not the answer so these combined with counseling is the solution ive needed for a long time i hope this help others
3635,xanax xr,im not sure if it doing anything no side effect o mg x daily
3637,alprazolam,take a prescribed can save your life a far a the downward cycle that start with stress then no sleep then more stress then le sleep then depression and repeat ad infitum if taken safely exercise therapy etc yes

3641,fluoxetine,i wa on paxil mg for year and my anxiety wa very minimal i switched to prozac couple of month ago because i thought the weight gain and side effect from paxil wa too much now after about week on prozac mg my anxiety isnt getting better and im often dealing with anxietypanic again my np tried to switch me from mg daily to mg day a week but i thought that wa making anxiety worse
3644,prozac,i would have to say this medicine really saved my life i couldnt even go through life at first i started to believe that i would deal with anxiety forever i highly recommend this medication to anyone suffering from anxiety at first my anxiety got worse and i wa nauseous and couldnt sleep but after about two and a half week my anxiety completely vanished i feel better than ever now and im only on the mg anyone wanting to take prozac i encourage you to
3646,prozac,this medication did not work for me at all it could possibly be because i dont metabolize ssri very well but i could not feel any sort of change when on this it helped a little with my minor ocd which i why i stayed on it for so long but after awhile it just triggered what my doctor said wa an underlying mood disorder because i started flip flopping between being content or even emotionless and being severely depressed this medication did not help me but im not going to say it wouldnt work for other people i just couldnt take the side effect
3647,xanax,i started on xanax after the birth of my second child for post partum anxiety i used ativan after my first baby but my new doctor wanted me to try xanax i thought it worked great at first my x a day most day i only took or my baby developed colic issue and my husband wa working hour a week so i had no help and wa going crazy from no sleep and endless hour of nonstop cry so they upped my dose to mg x a day thing calmed down around month so i tried to cut back down but ended up with severe panic attack and shaking etc even when i take my regular dose on time i am still struggling with increased heart rate shakiness irritability etc hoping to switch med or something at my next appointment

3677,alprazolam,i have severe anxiety and at time i cant even hold still i completely avoid going out due to the severity of it tried mg of xanax under the tongue and within ten minute i could feel the anxiety getting better zero negative side effect
3678,prozac,at first when i began taking prozac i had a lost more quotepisodesquot i just cried in my bedroom for hour i cant even describe the emotion if i could even call them that going through me it wa like a dark part of me took over and it wanted nothing but an end i dont even to what everything wa way worse multiple suicidal thought per a single day were not uncommon gradually i started feeling better there wa no sudden happiness or peace but i felt normal now i just dont know whats going on with me stress and everything is piling up on me once again eating is a chore i feel like im on the brink of falling apart on the thin line between sanityampinsanity i dont want life or death i want to not exist im just confused
3679,alprazolam,alprazolam offer a quotcleanerquot anxiolytic effect for me compared to ativan the quotwavinessquot in lorazepam isnt present in xanax though at the mg dosage level and above i do get a bit of confusion sometimes mg work well in a subtle way though it can be tempting to want to bring up the dose a bit i had a panic attack while on the medicine at mg and i couldnt get rid of it until i had taken mg and i fell asleep all in all xanax work for anxiety
3680,alprazolam,i have atrial fibrillation stress and panic attack this is a great medicine the heart doctor were wanting to place a pacemaker then they ran all the test my heart wa okay so i ended up on xanax but if you think you are having a heart attack get yourself to a again this is a great medicine for stress panic attack
3681,adderall,this is the most amazing medicine ive had problem with being unmotivated overweight and depressed for year and this drug can make me feel like a new person unfortunately im stuck taking these pill just so i can feel productive oddly though sometimes even when im not on the drug i feel a if im moving in fast motion but my brain isnt it very strange but i can deal with it

3685,amphetamine,year old college female ive been medicated for year now and tried concerta which wa hell and vyvanse the devil drug evekeo wa amazing at first kind of similar to vyvanse and then it went downhill whereas on vyvanse i just wouldnt eat and wa depressed and spacey this one didnt have side effect like that but after awhile it made me incredibly mean and didnt seem to take away the verbal impulse side of the hyperactivity im normally an incredibly happy person but when im on this medicine im a bitch to whoever over whatever for no reason at all it did help with the focusing though
3686,alprazolam,so many other review on here but this drug is important i will chime in a well since it ha been prescribed a little different for me i used to wake up in a panic a couple of time a week but it pretty easy for me to gauge my stress level and predict which night are going to be bad one i take or mg or night a week before am or ill be so zonked i dont respond to my alarm it doe the trick so i can fall right back to sleep after waking instead of panicking and then ruminating for hour and being a mess at work and with my kid the next day it work so well amp i can easily see how it would be addictive but it a lifechanger so i am very careful
3687,fluoxetine,i feel goodnot greatbut better than before i cant lose weight and i am on mg

3706,alprazolam,i wa diagnosed with panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder year ago i suffered for many year during that time and did not take any medication with the view that i would fix the issue naturally i tried the natural way for year avoidance behaviour became the norm and a way of coping year ago i wa at tipping point in a very stressful job and finally wa prescribed xanax alprazolam by a gp for the first time since my teen when the anxiety began i finally had relief this medication ha been a complete game changer for me and ha improved my quality of life by i have been taking mg twice a day for the past year and havent had to increase the dosage this medication is now sadly classified a a level drug in australia due to people who dont need it abusing the drug and ruining it for those who really need it my psychiatrist is now trying to switch me to ativan i have been taking it for approximately a month now and it make me feel depressed and empty and i have never had depression i need mg to ease my anxiety double the dose of xanax and it basically make me feel like crap feeling incredibly overwhelmed and annoyed that this medication which ha helped me so much will probably no longer be available in australia
3707,alprazolam,ive taken this medication for about year now i wa originally prescribed by my doctor after i had my son for moderate anxiety amp to prevent possible panic attack i also take wellbutrin for depression but that medication doe not calm me down like the xanax doe i have taken le of a dosage in the past but recently it been a little bit more because of getting divorced amp a close family member unexpectedly passing away so ive felt better on more amp a lot le anxiety taking just that one more dosage or so per day i know it is a difficult medication to stop but believe that it is better to lower dosage over time rather than completely stop taking it

3715,adderall,i took this medicine for add when i wa eleven id had some slight muscle tic before that and the doctor warned me and my parent that adderall could make those worse but at the time i wasnt too worried about it that wa a mistake the tic got far worse to the point that once i passed out because it made it difficult for me to breath one doctor said it wa ocd and another said it might be tourette and another thought it wa the medicine all i know is ive stopped taking it and theyve mostly gone away though they still come back every once in a while when im tired im not sure if adderall would have helped my quotaddquot i didnt take it long enough ive since managed to get it together and improve my grade without any medication
